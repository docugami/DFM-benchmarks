The above named parties desire to engage in discussions regarding a potential agreement or other transaction between the parties (the “Purpose”). In connection with such discussions, it may be necessary for the parties to disclose to each other certain confidential information or materials to enable them to evaluate whether to enter into such agreement or transaction.

In consideration of the foregoing, the parties agree as follows:

1.   Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means any information or materials disclosed by one party to the other party that: (i) if disclosed in writing or in the form of tangible materials, is marked “confidential” or “proprietary” at the time of such disclosure; (ii) if disclosed orally or by visual presentation, is identified as “confidential” or “proprietary” at the time of such disclosure, and is summarized in a writing sent by the disclosing party to the receiving party within thirty (30) days after any such disclosure; or (iii) due to its nature or the circumstances of its disclosure, a person exercising reasonable business judgment would understand to be confidential or proprietary.



2.   Obligations and Restrictions. Each party agrees: (i) to maintain the other party's Confidential Information in strict confidence; (ii) not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third party; and (iii) not to use such Confidential Information for any purpose except for the Purpose. Each party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to its employees and consultants who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for the Purpose, but solely to the extent necessary to pursue the Purpose and for no other purpose; provided, that each such employee and consultant first executes a written agreement (or is otherwise already bound by a written agreement) that contains use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective of the other party’s Confidential Information as those set forth in this Agreement.



3.   Exceptions. The obligations and restrictions in Section 2 will not apply to any information or materials that:



(i)   were, at the date of disclosure, or have subsequently become, generally known or available to the public through no act or failure to act by the receiving party;



(ii)  were rightfully known by the receiving party prior to receiving such information or materials from the disclosing party;



(iii)  are rightfully acquired by the receiving party from a third party who has the right to disclose such information or materials without breach of any confidentiality obligation to the disclosing party; or



(iv)  are independently developed by the receiving party without access to any Confidential Information of the disclosing party.





4.   Compelled Disclosure. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to restrict a party from disclosing the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by any order, subpoena, law, statute or regulation; provided, that the party required to make such a disclosure uses reasonable efforts to give the other party reasonable advance notice of such required disclosure in order to enable the other party to prevent or limit such disclosure.



5.   Return of Confidential Information. Upon the completion or abandonment of the Purpose, and in any event upon the disclosing party’s request, the receiving party will promptly return to the disclosing party all tangible items and embodiments containing or consisting of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information and all copies thereof (including electronic copies), and any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations, memoranda or other documents (regardless of the form thereof) prepared by or on behalf of the receiving party that contain or are based upon the disclosing party’s Confidential Information.



6.   No Obligations. Each party retains the right, in its sole discretion, to determine whether to disclose any Confidential Information to the other party. Neither party will be required to negotiate nor enter into any other agreements or arrangements with the other party, whether or not related to the Purpose.



7.   No License. All Confidential Information remains the sole and exclusive property of the disclosing party. Each party acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Agreement will be construed as granting any rights to the receiving party, by license or otherwise, in or to any Confidential Information of the disclosing party, or any patent, copyright or other intellectual property or proprietary rights of the disclosing party, except as specified in this Agreement.



8.   No Warranty. ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED BY THE DISCLOSING PARTY “AS IS”.



9.   Term. This Agreement will remain in effect for a period of five (5) years from the date of last disclosure of Confidential Information by either party, at which time it will terminate.



10.  Equitable Relief. Each party acknowledges that the unauthorized use or disclosure of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information may cause the disclosing party to incur irreparable harm and significant damages, the degree of which may be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, each party agrees that the disclosing party will have the right to seek immediate equitable relief to enjoin any unauthorized use or disclosure of its Confidential Information, in addition to any other rights and remedies that it may have at law or otherwise.



11.  Miscellaneous. This Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, excluding its body of law controlling conflict of laws.

"It is more likely that the etiology is kinin-related where angioedema results from generation of bradykinin and complement-derived mediators that increase vascular permeability since there is no urticaria or pruritis. The most likely cause is the Altace (ACEI) that the patient has been taking caused an increase in bradykinin since it decreases angiotensin 2 which degrades bradykinin. Bradykinin can then interact with vascular receptors increasing vasodilation, vascular permeability, increased cGMP and release of nitric oxide. This reaction occurs in .1-7% of patients treated with an ACEI and it typically involves the mouth, lips, tounge, larynx, pharynx and sublottic tissues. Half of these cases usually occur within a week of starting the ACEI but can occur years later. This is a class specific reaction not a drug specific and ARBs can cause the same reaction even though these drugs don’t effect the kinin metabolism. 50% of patients with angioedema due to an ARB also had an ACEI induced angioedema (Cicardi, M, Zingale, LC, Bergamschini L, Agostoni, A. Angioedema associated with agniotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use: outcome after switching to a different treatment. Arch Intern Med 2004; 164:910). Deficiency of C1 inhibitor can cause angioedema since levels of complement are reduced and cause increased bradykinin. This can be due to lack of C1 INH or adequate amounts of nonfunctional C1 INH. Other causes of angioedema include aspirin and NSAIDs since inhibition of cox and enzyme pathyway increases formation of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes.",Diagnosis,Angioedema Explanation

                   ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS SPECIFIC TO YOUR NOTE

             Assuming No Changes in Market Conditions and Other Relevant Factors, the Value of Your Note on the Date of This Pricing Supplement (As Determined by Reference to Pricing Models Used by Goldman Sachs) May Be Significantly Less than the Original Issue Price

                The value or quoted price of your note at any time will reflect many factors and cannot be predicted. If Goldman Sachs makes a market in the notes, the price quoted by us or our affiliates for your note would reflect any changes in market conditions and other relevant factors, including a deterioration in our creditworthiness or perceived creditworthiness whether measured by our credit ratings or other credit measures. These changes may adversely affect the market price of your notes, including the price you may receive for your notes in any market making transaction. In addition, even if our creditworthiness does not decline, the value of your note on the trade date may be significantly less than the original price taking into account our credit spreads on that date. The quoted price could be higher or lower than the original issue price, and may be higher or lower than the value of your note as determined by reference to pricing models used by Goldman Sachs.

                If at any time a third party dealer quotes a price to purchase your note or otherwise values your note, that price may be significantly different (higher or lower) than any price quoted by Goldman Sachs. See “Risk Factors — Considerations Relating to Notes Generally — The Market Price of Any Notes We May Issue May Be Influenced by Many Unpredictable Factors and If You Buy a Note and Sell It Prior to the Stated Maturity Date, You May Receive Less Than the Face Amount of Your Note” in the Offering Circular.

                Furthermore, if you sell your note, you will likely be charged a commission for secondary market transactions, or the price will likely reflect a dealer discount. There is no assurance that Goldman Sachs or any other party will be willing to purchase your note, and in this regard Goldman Sachs is not obligated to make a market in your note. See “Risk Factors—Considerations Relating to Notes Generally—Any Notes We May Issue May Not Have an Active Trading Market” in the Offering Circular.

             The Market Price of the Notes May Be

             Influenced by Many Unpredictable Factors and If You Sell Your Note Prior to the Stated Maturity Date, You May Receive Less Than the Accreted Value of Your Note

                 The following factors, most of which are beyond our control, will influence the market price of the notes:

              economic, military, financial, regulatory, political, terrorist and other events that affect securities generally;

              interest and yield rates in the market;

              the time remaining until a note matures; and

              our creditworthiness. As a result of these and other factors, if you sell your note prior to maturity, you may receive less than the accreted value of your note. Moreover, these factors interrelate in complex ways, and the effect of one factor may offset or enhance the effect of another factor.

             The Notes May Not Have an Active Trading Market

                 We have appointed KGI Securities Co. Ltd., and KGI Securities Co. Ltd. has agreed to act, as the liquidity provider for providing quotations in respect of the notes listed on the TPEx in accordance with Article 24-1 of the TPEx Rules and the relevant regulations.

                 Neither we, nor any of our affiliates, have any obligation to make a market in the notes. Even if a secondary market for the notes develops, it may not provide significant liquidity. The transaction costs in any such secondary market may be high. As a result, the difference between bid and asked prices for the note in any secondary market could be substantial.

             Listing of the Notes on TPEx

                 Application will be made for the listing of the notes on the TPEx. No assurance can be given as to whether the notes will be, or will remain,

             listed on the TPEx. If the notes fail to or cease to be listed on the TPEx, certain investors may not invest in, or continue to hold or invest in, the notes.

             We Have the Right to Redeem Your Note at Our Option

                On each early redemption date listed above, we will have the option to redeem your notes at a price equal to the product of (i) the face amount outstanding on such early redemption date, multiplied by (ii) the relevant early

                                                     S-7 redemption amount listed above which corresponds to such early redemption date, by notice to Euroclear Bank SA/NV and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme, no fewer than five (5) business days prior to the relevant early redemption date. Even if we do not exercise this option, our ability to do so may adversely affect the value of your notes.

"If Tenant timely disputes Landlord’s Determination and Landlord and Tenant fail to agree as to the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent (and, accordingly, the Rent payable by Tenant during the subject Renewal Term) within thirty (30) days after the giving of Tenant’s Notice, then the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent shall be determined as follows: A licensed real estate appraiser (the “Appraiser”) shall be selected and paid for jointly by Landlord and Tenant. If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree upon the Appraiser, then the same shall be designated by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The Appraiser selected by the parties or designated by the AAA shall have at least ten (10) years’ experience in the appraisal of retail space in Manhattan, NY. Landlord and Tenant shall each submit to the Appraiser and to the other its determination of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent. The parties shall instruct the Appraiser to (A) conduct the hearings and investigations that he or she deems appropriate, and 

 (B)  choose either Landlord's determination or Tenant's determination submitted to the Appraiser as the better estimate of Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent, being the determination which is closer to the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent determined by the Appraiser using the definition set forth in this Article 72, within thirty (30) days after the date that the Appraiser is designated. The Appraiser's aforesaid choice shall be conclusive and binding upon Landlord and Tenant. Each party shall pay its own counsel fees and expenses, if any, in connection with the procedure described herein, and fifty (50%) percent of any AAA fees and fees of the Appraiser. Either Landlord or Tenant shall have the right to submit to the Appraiser any material in support of its determination of Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent within ten (10) business days of the date of the selection of the Appraiser. After a determination has been made of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent, the parties shall execute and deliver a lease amendment memorializing the extension of the Term as described in this Article 72 and setting forth the Rent payable by Tenant during the Renewal Term, but the failure to so execute and deliver any such instrument shall not affect the determination of Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent (and, accordingly, the Rent payable during the Renewal Term). 





 (iii) If Tenant timely disputes Landlord’s Determination and if the final determination of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent shall not be made on or before the first day of the subject Renewal Term then, pending such final determination, Tenant shall pay, as Rent for the subject Renewal Term, an amount equal to Landlord’s Determination. If, based upon the final determination of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent, the Rent payments made by Tenant for such portion of the subject Renewal Term were (i) less than they should have been, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord the amount of such deficiency within ten (10) business days after demand therefor, or (ii) greater than they should have been, then Landlord shall credit the amount of such excess against installments of Rent next coming due. 



         Time shall be of the essence with respect to all obligations under this Article 72.

Tenant shall pay to Landlord any reasonable fees or expenses in connection with Tenant's Alterations incurred by Landlord in connection with Landlord's submitting such plans and specifications, if it so chooses, to an architect or engineer selected by Landlord for review or examination. Tenant shall pay to Landlord the minimum sum of $750.00 to reimburse Landlord for the administrative costs of initial review and processing of proposed Tenant’s Alterations plans and specifications, in each instance; and if, in connection therewith, Landlord incurs expenses in excess of said $750.00 amount, then Tenant shall pay Landlord the amount of such excess fees as additional rent within ten (10) days of Landlord’s submission to Tenant of bills for same.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely in connection with Tenant’s Initial Alterations (defined below), Tenant shall not be required to pay Landlord or its designee for Landlord’s review of Tenant’s Initial Alterations plans or Landlord’s supervision, if any, or any other Landlord out-of-pocket cost of Tenant’s Initial Alterations or post a bond to insure the completion of and payment for Tenant's Alterations. “Initial Alterations” shall refer to the alterations made to the Premises by Tenant as part of, and as approved by Landlord as, Tenant’s initial build-out of the Premises prior to commencement of operations by Tenant.

 (iii) one-half of the monthly fixed rent due ($13,000.00) for the eighteenth month following the Commencement Date; and (iv) one-half of the monthly fixed rent due ($13,000.00) for the nineteenth month following the Commencement Date.

 (ii) the amount of $78,000.00 representing the security deposit. 



 Tenant also covenants to pay, from time to time as provided in this Lease, as additional rent: all other amounts and obligations which Tenant assumes or agrees to pay under this Lease; a “Late Charge” equal to five percent (5%) of the overdue payment of any item of fixed or additional rent not paid within ten (10) days after the date when due (or, if a demand therefor is required by the provisions of this Lease, within ten (10) days after the date of such demand), which Late Charge shall be payable as additional rent. In the event of any failure on the part of Tenant to pay any additional rent, Landlord shall have all the rights, powers and remedies provided for in this Lease, at law, in equity or otherwise, in the case of nonpayment of fixed rent. Nothing herein shall be construed to extend the due dates of Tenant's payments under this Lease, or to waive any rights or remedies of Landlord in the event of Tenant's late payment. Tenant's obligations to pay fixed rent and additional rent shall survive the expiration of the Lease term or earlier termination of this Lease. 





 The provisions of this Article are in addition to all other rights or remedies available to Landlord for nonpayment of fixed rent or additional rent under this Lease and at law and in equity. Tenant further agrees that the Late Charge imposed is fair and reasonable, complies with all laws, regulations and statutes, and constitutes an agreement between Landlord and Tenant as to the estimated compensation for costs and administrative expenses incurred by Landlord due to the late payment of rent to Landlord by Tenant. Tenant further agrees that the Late Charge assessed pursuant to this Lease is not interest and the Late Charge assessed does not constitute a lender or borrower/creditor relationship between Landlord and Tenant or a penalty of any kind. It is understood that said late charge is directly related to Landlord’s actual costs and expenses incurred as a result of late payment.

 All rent shall be paid to Landlord without notice, demand, counterclaim, setoff, deduction or defense, and nothing shall suspend, defer, diminish, abate, or reduce any rent, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Lease or by law. 



 Tenant shall make all rental payments in full. Payment or receipt of a rental payment of less than the amount stated in this Lease shall be deemed to be nothing more than partial payment on account. Under no circumstances shall Landlord’s acceptance of a partial payment constitute accord and satisfaction. Nor will Landlord’s acceptance of a partial payment forfeit Landlord’s right to collect the balance due on the account, together with applicable late charges and interest despite any endorsement, stipulation, or other statement on any check. 



 Landlord may accept any partial payment check with any conditional endorsement without prejudice to its right to recover the balance remaining due, or to pursue any other remedy available under this Lease, law or equity. 



 Landlord in its sole discretion may allocate without prejudice any payment in whole or in part to any due item of fixed rent, additional rent and/or any other charges or to any combination thereof. 



 If Landlord commences any action or proceeding against Tenant, or if Landlord is required to defend any action or proceeding commenced by Tenant, in connection with this lease or the Premises, and Landlord shall be the prevailing party in any such action for proceeding, Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant in such action or proceeding, or a subsequently commenced action or proceeding, Landlord's reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements and all applicable interest thereon at the statutory rate incurred in connection with such action or proceeding and any appeals, including but not limited to fees on fees incurred to collect said monies. 



 Landlord’s failure during the Lease term to prepare and deliver any of the statements, notices, or bills for rent and/or additional rent or Landlord’s failure to make a demand, shall not in any way cause Landlord to forfeit or surrender its rights to collect any of the items of rent and/or additional rent that may have become due during the term of this Lease. Tenant’s liability for all such amounts due under this Lease shall survive the expiration of the Term. Nevertheless, any sums due under the Lease must be claimed within two years of when due or within one year from expiration of the Lease.

"MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (this “Agreement”) is entered into and made effective as of April 4, 2018 between Docugami Inc., a Delaware corporation, whose address is 150 Lake Street South, Suite 221, Kirkland, Washington 98033, and Caleb Divine, an individual, whose address is 1201 Rt 300, Newburgh NY 12550.

The above named parties desire to engage in discussions regarding a potential agreement or other transaction between the parties (the “Purpose”). In connection with such discussions, it may be necessary for the parties to disclose to each other certain confidential information or materials to enable them to evaluate whether to enter into such agreement or transaction.

In consideration of the foregoing, the parties agree as follows:

1.        Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means any information or materials disclosed by one party to the other party that: (i) if disclosed in writing or in the form of tangible materials, is marked “confidential” or “proprietary” at the time of such disclosure; (ii) if disclosed orally or by visual presentation, is identified as “confidential” or “proprietary” at the time of such disclosure, and is summarized in a writing sent by the disclosing party to the receiving party within thirty (30) days after any such disclosure; or (iii) due to its nature or the circumstances of its disclosure, a person exercising reasonable business judgment would understand to be confidential or proprietary.



2.        Obligations and Restrictions. Each party agrees: (i) to maintain the other party's Confidential Information in strict confidence; (ii) not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third party; and (iii) not to use such Confidential Information for any purpose except for the Purpose. Each party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to its employees and consultants who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for the Purpose, but solely to the extent necessary to pursue the Purpose and for no other purpose; provided, that each such employee and consultant first executes a written agreement (or is otherwise already bound by a written agreement) that contains use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective of the other party’s Confidential Information as those set forth in this Agreement.



3.        Exceptions. The obligations and restrictions in Section 2 will not apply to any information or materials that:



(i)        were, at the date of disclosure, or have subsequently become, generally known or available to the public through no act or failure to act by the receiving party;



(ii)        were rightfully known by the receiving party prior to receiving such information or materials from the disclosing party;



(iii)        are rightfully acquired by the receiving party from a third party who has the right to disclose such information or materials without breach of any confidentiality obligation to the disclosing party;





4.        Compelled Disclosure. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to restrict a party from disclosing the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by any order, subpoena, law, statute or regulation; provided, that the party required to make such a disclosure uses reasonable efforts to give the other party reasonable advance notice of such required disclosure in order to enable the other party to prevent or limit such disclosure.



5.        Return of Confidential Information. Upon the completion or abandonment of the Purpose, and in any event upon the disclosing party’s request, the receiving party will promptly return to the disclosing party all tangible items and embodiments containing or consisting of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information and all copies thereof (including electronic copies), and any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations, memoranda or other documents (regardless of the form thereof) prepared by or on behalf of the receiving party that contain or are based upon the disclosing party’s Confidential Information.



6.        No Obligations. Each party retains the right to determine whether to disclose any Confidential Information to the other party.



7.        No Warranty. ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED BY THE DISCLOSING PARTY “AS IS”.



8.        Term. This Agreement will remain in effect for a period of seven (7) years from the date of last disclosure of Confidential Information by either party, at which time it will terminate.



9.        Equitable Relief. Each party acknowledges that the unauthorized use or disclosure of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information may cause the disclosing party to incur irreparable harm and significant damages, the degree of which may be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, each party agrees that the disclosing party will have the right to seek immediate equitable relief to enjoin any unauthorized use or disclosure of its Confidential Information, in addition to any other rights and remedies that it may have at law or otherwise.



10.        Non-compete. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, Caleb Divine may not market software products or do business that directly or indirectly competes with Docugami software products.



11.        Miscellaneous. This Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, excluding its body of law controlling conflict of laws. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings and communications, oral or written, between the parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision of this Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Neither party may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without the other party’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment without such consent will be void.

41. Escalations 



 Tenant shall pay, during the term of this Lease, the additional rent provided for in this Article 41. As used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below: 



 “Taxes” shall mean the total of all real estate taxes and assessments and special assessments imposed, payable and paid upon the Premises described as the land and building in which the Premises are located including, without limitation, vault taxes, rents or charges, imposed by any Governmental Authority, of which the demised Premises forms a part. If at any time during the term of this Lease the methods of taxation prevailing at the commencement of the term hereof shall be altered so that in lieu of or as a substitute for the whole or any part of the taxes, assessments, levies, impositions of charges now levied, assessed or imposed on the real estate and the improvements thereon, there shall be levied, assessed or imposed (i) a tax, assessment, levy imposition or charge wholly or partially as capital levy or otherwise on the rents received therefrom, or (ii) a tax assessment levy upon the Building, Land Improvements or the Premises and imposed upon Landlord, or (iii) a license fee measured by the rents payable, or the part thereof so measured or based shall be deemed to be included within the term ""Taxes"" for the purposes hereof. 



 ""Escalation Year"" shall mean each twelve month period or portion thereof, ending on June 30, occurring within the term of this Lease. 



 ""Base Year"" shall mean the twelve month period ending on June 30, 2022. 



 ""Base Year Taxes"" shall mean the Taxes for the Base Year. 



 The ""building"" shall mean the land and the building of which the demised Premises forms a part. ""Tenant's Share"" shall mean 35%. 

 Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as additional rent, an amount equal to Tenant's Share of the amount by which Taxes for any Escalation Year during the term of this Lease exceed the Base Year Taxes. 



 Landlord shall submit to Tenant a statement setting forth the computation of the amount of such excess Taxes and Tenant's Share of each thereof including copies of applicable tax bills. Tenant shall pay Tenant's Share of such excess amount of Taxes within ten days after the rendition of such statement which shall separately calculate Tenant’s Share, however, the payment of Tenant's Share shall not be due earlier than 10 days before the corresponding Taxes are due to the taxing authority. 



         In no event shall the annual fixed rent under this Lease be reduced by virtue of this Article 

 41.  The computations under this Article 41 are intended to constitute a formula for an agreed rental escalation and do not necessarily constitute an actual reimbursement to Landlord for costs or expenses paid by Landlord with respect to the building. 





 Upon the date of the expiration of the Lease term or earlier termination of this Lease, a proportionate share of the additional rent payable under this Article 41 for the Escalation Year during which such expiration or termination occurs shall immediately become due and payable by Tenant to Landlord. Said proportionate share shall be based on the length of time that the term of this Lease shall be within such Escalation Year. Promptly after such expiration or termination, Landlord shall compute the additional rent due from Tenant, as aforesaid, which computation shall be an estimate based upon the most recent annual statements theretofore furnished by Landlord to Tenant. Upon written request by Tenant, Landlord shall cause a final statement showing the computation of the actual additional rent due from Tenant for that Escalation Year to be prepared and furnished to Tenant, whereupon any appropriate adjustments of 





 amount owed to Landlord shall be made. The obligations of Tenant to pay additional rent as provided for herein shall survive the expiration of the Lease term or earlier termination of this Lease. If Tenant continues in possession of the Premises after the expiration of the Lease term or earlier termination of this Lease, as a month to month tenant or otherwise, the provisions of this Article 41 shall continue in full force and effect for so long as Tenant remains in possession of the Premises. 



 The additional rent provided for herein shall be collectible by Landlord in the same manner as the regular installments of fixed rent due under this Lease. Notwithstanding anything set forth elsewhere in this Article or elsewhere in this Lease, no delay or failure by Landlord in preparing or delivering any statement or demand for any additional rent, including but not limited to the statements and/or demands provided for in this Article, shall constitute a waiver of, or impair Landlord's rights to collect, such additional rent. 



 The billing statements provided by Landlord for the charges due pursuant to this Article 41 shall constitute a final determination as between Landlord and Tenant of the additional rent for the periods represented thereby, unless Tenant within thirty days after they have been furnished shall give a written notice to Landlord that Tenant disputes their accuracy or appropriateness, which written notice shall specify the particular respects in which the statement is inaccurate or inappropriate. Pending the resolution of such dispute, Tenant shall pay the additional rent to Landlord in accordance with the statements furnished by Landlord. 



 In addition to Taxes as set forth above, Tenant shall pay within ten (10) days after invoice therefor,including copies of applicable bill, an amount equal to Tenant's Share of the amount by which any charges imposed by any Business Improvement District on the Premises or any Escalation Year during the term of this Lease exceed Business Improvement District Charges in the Base Year. 



42. Use of Premises 



 Tenant covenants that Tenant shall use and occupy the Premises solely as a first class high quality café, coffee shop, and restaurant with full table service for all day breakfast, lunch and dinner and other uses incidental thereto, including the sale of liquor with the required license, and for no other purpose unless approved in writing by Landlord at all times. Tenant shall not have the right to operate its business in the Premises except between the hours of 7:00 A.M. through 2:00 A.M. 



 Tenant shall not knowingly use or occupy or permit the Premises to be used or occupied, nor do or permit anything to be done in or on the Premises, in any manner which in any way will violate any rules and regulations of governmental authorities, any certificate of occupancy affecting the Premises, or make void or voidable any insurance then in force with respect to the Premises. In the event that any governmental authority shall contend or declare by notice of violation or order, or otherwise, that the Premises are being used in a manner in violation of any law, rule or regulation or in violation of any certificate of occupancy, Tenant, within ten days after written notice shall discontinue such use of the Premises, and failure to discontinue such use shall constitute a material default by Tenant hereunder. The statement in this Lease of the nature of Tenant's business shall not be deemed or construed to constitute a representation or warranty by Landlord that such business may be conducted in the Premises or is lawful or permissible under any certificate of occupancy issued for the building. 



 Tenant shall as its sole responsibility, and at Tenant's sole cost and expense, take all action, including making any required alterations necessary to comply with all Requirements (including, but not limited to, applicable terms of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (the ""ADA""), as modified and supplemented from time to time, which shall impose any violation, order or duty upon Landlord or Tenant arising from, or in connection with, the Premises, Tenant's occupancy, use or manner of use of the Premises (including, without limitation, any occupancy, use or manner of use that constitutes a ""place of public accommodation"" under the ADA), or any installations in the Premises, or required by reason of a breach of any of Tenant's covenants or agreements under this Lease, whether or not such Requirements shall now be in effect or hereafter enacted or issued, and whether or not any work required shall be ordinary or extraordinary or foreseen or unforeseen at the date hereof.

"Except as provided herein, Tenant shall not be entitled to make any structural alterations of or additions to the Premises or any alterations, additions or changes whatsoever to the exterior of the Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord in each instance, which consent Landlord may withhold or condition unreasonably or for any reason or for no reason; and, except as provided herein , and excepting purely cosmetic changes or additions up to an amount of $20,000, Tenant shall not be entitled to make any non-structural alterations of or additions to the Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord in each instance, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. (Any alterations to the Premises made by Tenant shall hereinafter be referred to as ""Tenant's Alterations""). 



 In granting its consent to any Tenant's Alterations as defined in this Article, Landlord may impose such reasonable conditions (including completion, payment, restoration and if Tenant's Alterations are reasonably expected to cost in excess of $25,000, a requirement that Tenant either post a bond to insure the completion of and payment for Tenant's Alterations or furnish Landlord with other financial security reasonably satisfactory to Landlord to assure Landlord that Tenant’s Alterations will be completed lien free) as Landlord may reasonably require. In no event shall Landlord be required to consent to any Tenant's Alterations which would physically affect any part of the Building outside of the Premises or would adversely affect the proper functioning of the mechanical, electrical, sanitary or other service systems of the Building. At the time Tenant requests Landlord's written consent to Tenant’s Alterations, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord detailed plans and specifications therefor. Tenant shall pay to Landlord any reasonable fees or expenses in connection with Tenant's Alterations incurred by Landlord in connection with Landlord's submitting such plans and specifications, if it so chooses, to an architect or engineer selected by Landlord for review or examination. Tenant shall pay to Landlord the minimum sum of $750.00 to reimburse Landlord for the administrative costs of initial review and processing of proposed Tenant’s Alterations plans and specifications, in each instance; and if, in connection therewith, Landlord incurs expenses in excess of said $750.00 amount, then Tenant shall pay Landlord the amount of such excess fees as additional rent within ten (10) days of Landlord’s submission to Tenant of bills for same. Landlord's approval of any plans or specifications does not relieve Tenant from the responsibility for the legal sufficiency and technical competency thereof. Before commencement of any Tenant’s Alterations, (a) Tenant shall obtain the necessary consents, authorizations and licenses from all federal, state and/or municipal authorities having jurisdiction over such work, and (b) Tenant shall provide Landlord with a bond insuring Landlord against non-payment for any work to be performed by Tenant or furnish Landlord with other financial security reasonably satisfactory to Landlord to assure Landlord that Tenant’s Alterations will be completed lien free. Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely in connection with Tenant’s Initial Alterations (defined below), Tenant shall not be required to pay Landlord or its designee for Landlord’s review of Tenant’s Initial Alterations plans or Landlord’s supervision, if any, or any other Landlord out-of-pocket cost of Tenant’s Initial Alterations or post a bond to insure the completion of and payment for Tenant's Alterations. “Initial Alterations” shall refer to the alterations made to the Premises by Tenant as part of, and as approved by Landlord as, Tenant’s initial build-out of the Premises prior to commencement of operations by Tenant. Landlord consents to Tenant’s Initial Alterations described on annexed Exhibit D. Tenant agrees to indemnify and save Landlord harmless from and against any and all bills for labor performed and equipment, fixtures and materials furnished to Tenant and applicable sales taxes thereon as required by New York law and from and against any and all liens, bills or claims therefor or against the Premises or the Building and from and against all losses, damages, costs, expenses, suits, and claims whatsoever in connection with Tenant’s Alterations. 



 Tenant, at its expense, shall cause any Tenant’s Alterations consented to by Landlord to be performed in compliance with all applicable requirements of insurance bodies having jurisdiction and in such manner as not to interfere with, delay or impose any additional expense upon the Landlord in the maintenance or operation of the Building. 



 If the performance of Tenant’s Alterations shall interfere with the comfort and/or convenience of other tenants in the Building or shall cause damage to or otherwise interfere with the 





 occupancy of adjacent Buildings, Tenant shall upon Landlord's demand remedy or remove the condition or conditions complained of. Tenant further covenants and agrees to save Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, costs, expenses including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, suits and demands whatsoever made or asserted against Landlord by reason of the foregoing. 



 Tenant’s Alterations may be performed only from Monday through Friday and only during the hours from 9:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. and at no other times. 



 Promptly after the completion of any Tenant’s Alterations, Tenant shall furnish to Landlord a complete set of ""as-built"" plans and specifications. 



 Tenant agrees that any exercise of its rights pursuant to this Lease shall not be done in a manner that would: (a) create any work stoppage, picketing, labor disruption, or dispute; (b) materially interfere with the business of Landlord or any tenant or occupant of the Building. In the event of the occurrence of any condition described above arising from Tenant's exercise of any of its rights pursuant to this Lease, Tenant shall, immediately upon notice from Landlord, cease the manner of exercise of such right giving rise to such condition. In the event that Tenant fails to cease the manner of exercise of its rights as aforesaid, Landlord, in addition to any rights available to it under this lease and pursuant to law, shall have the right to injunction without further notice. 



 Promptly following the completion of all of Tenant’s Alterations, and as soon as reasonably feasible, Tenant shall obtain and furnish to Landlord all appropriate certifications, including but not limited to a New York City Department of Buildings Letter of Completion, from all authorities having jurisdiction to the effect that all Tenant’s Alterations have been performed and completed in accordance with Tenant's Plans and with all Requirements, and Tenant shall close out all permits and obtain all final sign-offs. In the event that Tenant fails to comply with the terms of this paragraph within 90 days after the completion of Tenant’s Alterations, then in that event, Landlord may, but is not required to, take such steps as are commercially reasonable to close out all permits, obtain final sign-offs and a Letter of Completion and otherwise act to cause Tenant’s obligations under this paragraph to be satisfied and thereupon Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all costs and fees incurred by Landlord in connection therewith as additional rent within 15 days of demand by Landlord for payment. 



 Subject to all of the foregoing provisions hereof, including without limitation, the compliance with Requirements, Tenant shall only be permitted to commence and carry on Tenant’s Alterations provided: (i) Tenant delivers to Landlord not less than three (3) days prior to the commencement of Tenant's Alterations, an endorsement of its liability insurance policy referred to herein, covering and holding Landlord harmless against any and all claims or liability arising out of Tenant’s Alterations; (ii) Tenant delivers to Landlord, not less than five days prior to the commencement of Tenant's Alterations, sufficient proof that Tenant's contractors maintain workers compensation insurance to cover all persons engaged in Tenant's Alterations; and (iii) Landlord is reasonably satisfied that Tenant's contractors will perform Tenant's Alterations in a first-class workman-like manner, using all first-class materials.

 Tenant hereby waives any and all rights of recovery against Landlord, its officers, members, agents, and employees, occurring on or arising out of the use and occupation of the Premises or the building to the extent such loss or damage is covered by proceeds received from insurance required under this Lease to be carried.

Tenant shall indemnify Landlord against any loss or expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from the failure to obtain such waiver. This waiver shall be in addition to, and not in limitation or derogation of, any other waiver or release contained in this Lease with respect to any loss of, or damage to, property of the parties hereto or bodily injury to either party or to members of the public. Inasmuch as the above waiver will preclude the assignment of any aforesaid claim by way of subrogation to an insurance company, Tenant agrees immediately to give to each insurance company providing a policy described in this Article, written notice of the terms of said waiver, and to have said insurance policies properly endorsed, if necessary, to prevent the invalidation of said insurance coverages by reason of said waiver.

Such insurance may be provided through a blanket policy or policies in form and substance satisfactory to Landlord.

 If at any time Tenant shall neglect or fail to provide or maintain insurance or to deliver insurance policies in accordance with this Article, Landlord may effect such insurance as agent for Tenant, by taking out policies in a company satisfactory to Landlord, and the amount of the premiums paid for such 





 insurance shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord on demand. Landlord, in addition to Landlord's other rights, powers and remedies, shall be entitled to recover as damages for any breach of this Article the uninsured amount of any liability, claim, loss, damage or expense, including reasonable attorneys' fees, suffered or incurred by Landlord, and shall not be limited in the proof of damages which Landlord may claim against Tenant to the amount of the insurance premiums not paid or incurred by Tenant which would have been payable for such insurance.",Tenant Insurance Requirements,Insurance Requirements

 In the event that the Premises are not surrendered at the end of the Lease term, Tenant shall indemnify and save Landlord harmless against all costs, claims, loss, or liability resulting from delay by Tenant in so surrendering the Premises, including, without limitation, any claims made by any succeeding tenant founded on such delay. 



 Additionally, the parties recognize and agree that other damage to Landlord resulting from any failure by Tenant to timely surrender the Premises will be substantial, will exceed the amount of monthly rent theretofore payable hereunder, and will be impossible of accurate measurement. Tenant therefore agrees that if possession of the Premises is not surrendered to Landlord within one (1) day after the date of the expiration or sooner termination of the term of this Lease, then Tenant will pay Landlord as liquidated damages for each month and for each portion of any month during which Lessee holds over in the Premises after the expiration of the term of this Lease, a sum equal to one and one-half (1.5) times the average rent and additional rent which was payable per month under this Lease during the last six months of the term thereof, which sum Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord upon demand, in full, without set-off or deduction, and which sum Tenant agrees is fair and reasonable and does not constitute a penalty. (“Holdover Use and Occupancy”). 



Nothing contained in this clause shall be construed to mean that the Landlord has given permission for Tenant or anyone else who occupies the Premises to remain on the Premises as a monthly Tenant, or as a Tenant from month to month and the Landlord may proceed to evict the Tenant as a ""Holdover."" Neither the billing nor the collection of use and occupancy in the above amount shall be deemed a waiver of any right of the Landlord to collect damages for Tenant's failure to vacate the Premises after the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease. If Tenant holds over in possession after the expiration or sooner termination of the term of this Lease, such holding over shall not be deemed to extend the term or renew the Lease, but such holding over thereafter shall continue upon the covenants and conditions herein set forth in the Lease. The aforesaid obligations shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of the term of this Lease. 



 In the event that on the date the Landlord repossesses the Premises under any provision of this Lease or upon the termination of this Lease or upon the expiration of the demised term, whichever is earlier, there remains within the Premises any property belonging to the Tenant said property shall be deemed to have been abandoned by the Tenant, at which time the Landlord may remove said property and dispose of said property in any manner as it deems fit, without any liability whatsoever. 



 In the event that the Premises are not surrendered at the end of the Lease term, Tenant shall indemnify Landlord against loss or liability resulting from Tenant's delay in surrendering the Premises thereafter until said Premises are surrendered.",End of Term,Holdover Indemnification
"Tenant covenants and agrees, at its sole cost and expense, to comply with all present and future Requirements regarding the collection, sorting, separation, and recycling of waste products, garbage, refuse and trash. Tenant shall sort and separate such waste products, garbage, refuse and trash into such categories as provided by law. Each separately sorted category of waste products, garbage, refuse and trash shall be placed in separate receptacles reasonably approved by Landlord and/or the Controlling Governmental agency(ies). Such separate receptacles may, at Landlord's option, be removed from the demised Premises in accordance with a collection schedule prescribed by law.",Waste Sorting and Recycling,Waste Products and Recycling

In the event of any failure on the part of Tenant to pay any additional rent, Landlord shall have all the rights, powers and remedies provided for in this Lease, at law, in equity or otherwise, in the case of nonpayment of fixed rent. Nothing herein shall be construed to extend the due dates of Tenant's payments under this Lease, or to waive any rights or remedies of Landlord in the event of Tenant's late payment. Tenant's obligations to pay fixed rent and additional rent shall survive the expiration of the Lease term or earlier termination of this Lease. 





 The provisions of this Article are in addition to all other rights or remedies available to Landlord for nonpayment of fixed rent or additional rent under this Lease and at law and in equity. Tenant further agrees that the Late Charge imposed is fair and reasonable, complies with all laws, regulations and statutes, and constitutes an agreement between Landlord and Tenant as to the estimated compensation for costs and administrative expenses incurred by Landlord due to the late payment of rent to Landlord by Tenant. Tenant further agrees that the Late Charge assessed pursuant to this Lease is not interest and the Late Charge assessed does not constitute a lender or borrower/creditor relationship between Landlord and Tenant or a penalty of any kind.

 Tenant shall make all rental payments in full. Payment or receipt of a rental payment of less than the amount stated in this Lease shall be deemed to be nothing more than partial payment on account. Under no circumstances shall Landlord’s acceptance of a partial payment constitute accord and satisfaction. Nor will Landlord’s acceptance of a partial payment forfeit Landlord’s right to collect the balance due on the account, together with applicable late charges and interest despite any endorsement, stipulation, or other statement on any check. 



 Landlord may accept any partial payment check with any conditional endorsement without prejudice to its right to recover the balance remaining due, or to pursue any other remedy available under this Lease, law or equity. 



 Landlord in its sole discretion may allocate without prejudice any payment in whole or in part to any due item of fixed rent, additional rent and/or any other charges or to any combination thereof.

 Landlord’s failure during the Lease term to prepare and deliver any of the statements, notices, or bills for rent and/or additional rent or Landlord’s failure to make a demand, shall not in any way cause Landlord to forfeit or surrender its rights to collect any of the items of rent and/or additional rent that may have become due during the term of this Lease. Tenant’s liability for all such amounts due under this Lease shall survive the expiration of the Term. Nevertheless, any sums due under the Lease must be claimed within two years of when due or within one year from expiration of the Lease.

 ""Base Year"" shall mean the twelve month period ending on June 30, 2022. 



 ""Base Year Taxes"" shall mean the Taxes for the Base Year. 



 The ""building"" shall mean the land and the building of which the demised Premises forms a part. ""Tenant's Share"" shall mean 35%. 

 Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as additional rent, an amount equal to Tenant's Share of the amount by which Taxes for any Escalation Year during the term of this Lease exceed the Base Year Taxes. 



 Landlord shall submit to Tenant a statement setting forth the computation of the amount of such excess Taxes and Tenant's Share of each thereof including copies of applicable tax bills. Tenant shall pay Tenant's Share of such excess amount of Taxes within ten days after the rendition of such statement which shall separately calculate Tenant’s Share, however, the payment of Tenant's Share shall not be due earlier than 10 days before the corresponding Taxes are due to the taxing authority. 



         In no event shall the annual fixed rent under this Lease be reduced by virtue of this Article 

 41.  The computations under this Article 41 are intended to constitute a formula for an agreed rental escalation and do not necessarily constitute an actual reimbursement to Landlord for costs or expenses paid by Landlord with respect to the building.

                 77 y o woman in NAD with a h/o CAD, DM2, asthma and HTN on altace for 8 years awoke from sleep around 2:30 am this morning of a sore throat and swelling of tongue. She came immediately to the ED b/c she was having difficulty swallowing and some trouble breathing due to obstruction caused by the swelling. She has never had a similar reaction ever before and she did not have any associated SOB, chest pain, itching, or nausea. She has not noticed any rashes, and has been afebrile. She says that she feels like it is swollen down in her esophagus as well. In the ED she was given 25mg benadryl IV, 125 mg solumedrol IV and pepcid 20 mg IV. This has helped the swelling some but her throat still hurts and it hurts to swallow. Nothing else was able to relieve the pain and nothing make it worse though she has not tried to drink any fluids because of trouble swallowing. She denies any recent travel, recent exposure to unusual plants or animals or other allergens. She has not started any new medications, has not used any new lotions or perfumes and has not eaten any unusual foods. Patient has not taken any of her oral medications today.

                 Assessment and Plan:

                 77 yo woman presents with significant angioedema in left side of tongue and inner cheek. Possible causes of angioedema include allergic anaphylaxis reaction, drug induced, allergic contact dermatitis, viral infection, drug induced, or a C1 inhibitor deficiency disorder acquired or hereditary. Laryngeal edema can also be caused by tonsillitis, peritonsilar abscess or pharyngeal foreign body.

                 It is unlikely that the patient has edema caused by abscess or tonsillitis since she does not have any associated fever or other signs of infection and the sudden onset of her swelling also argues against this. It is not likely a foreign body since ENT did not find anything when they scoped her.

                 It is unlikely that it is caused by a mast cell mediated etiologigy that increases vascular permeability through mast cell degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators include allergic angioedema, autoimmune mast cell release and direct mast cell release caused by medications such as opiates and radiocontrast media. It is not likely this type of reaction because these etiologies are associated with urticaria and pruritis, which the patient did not have. Also the patient did not have any exposure to a new pet, food, lotion or any other allergen or medication that could cause an allergic type reaction. The patient also does not have any history of autoimmune disease or any reaction similar to this in the past

                 It is more likely that the etiology is kinin-related where angioedema results from generation of bradykinin and complement-derived mediators that increase vascular permeability since there is no urticaria or pruritis. The most likely cause is the Altace (ACEI) that the patient has been taking caused an increase in bradykinin since it decreases angiotensin 2 which degrades bradykinin. Bradykinin can then interact with vascular receptors increasing vasodilation, vascular permeability, increased cGMP and release of nitric oxide. This reaction occurs in .1-7% of patients treated with an ACEI and it typically involves the mouth, lips, tounge, larynx, pharynx and sublottic tissues. Half of these cases usually occur within a week of starting the ACEI but can occur years later. This is a class specific reaction not a drug specific and ARBs can cause the same reaction even though these drugs don’t effect the kinin metabolism. 50% of patients with angioedema due to an ARB also had an ACEI induced angioedema (Cicardi, M, Zingale, LC, Bergamschini L, Agostoni, A. Angioedema associated with agniotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use: outcome after switching to a different treatment. Arch Intern Med 2004; 164:910). Deficiency of C1 inhibitor can cause angioedema since levels of complement are reduced and cause increased bradykinin. This can be due to lack of C1 INH or adequate amounts of nonfunctional C1 INH. Other causes of angioedema include aspirin and NSAIDs since inhibition of cox and enzyme pathyway increases formation of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes.

                 Other possibilities in the differential of causes of swelling include cellulitis, autoimmune conditions including SLE, polymyositis, dermatomyositis and sjorgren’s syndrome. Hypothyroidism can cuase puffiness of face and lips, hyperthyroidism can cause an infiltrative dermopathy, superior vena cava syndrome and tumors can cause venous engorgement and swelling. It is not likely one of these etiologies since the patient is on an ACEI and the swelling is restricted only to her tongue and throat typical of ACEI angioedema.

                 Plan:

                 ++Swollen tongue:

 The fixed rent shall be payable in advance on the first day of each calendar month commencing five months following the Commencement Date (the “Rent Commencement Date’) . Provided Tenant is not in default under any term of this Lease Tenant shall receive a rent credit for (i)) one-half of the monthly fixed rent due ($13,000.00) for the sixth month following the Commencement Date; (ii) one- half of the monthly fixed rent due ($13,000.00) for the seventh month following the Commencement Date; 

 (iii) one-half of the monthly fixed rent due ($13,000.00) for the eighteenth month following the Commencement Date; and (iv) one-half of the monthly fixed rent due ($13,000.00) for the nineteenth month following the Commencement Date. 



 At execution of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord by separate bank checks (i) the amount of $26,000.00 toward fixed rent for for the seventh month following the Commencement Date and 

 (ii) the amount of $78,000.00 representing the security deposit. 



 Tenant also covenants to pay, from time to time as provided in this Lease, as additional rent: all other amounts and obligations which Tenant assumes or agrees to pay under this Lease; a “Late Charge” equal to five percent (5%) of the overdue payment of any item of fixed or additional rent not paid within ten (10) days after the date when due (or, if a demand therefor is required by the provisions of this Lease, within ten (10) days after the date of such demand), which Late Charge shall be payable as additional rent. In the event of any failure on the part of Tenant to pay any additional rent, Landlord shall have all the rights, powers and remedies provided for in this Lease, at law, in equity or otherwise, in the case of nonpayment of fixed rent. Nothing herein shall be construed to extend the due dates of Tenant's payments under this Lease, or to waive any rights or remedies of Landlord in the event of Tenant's late payment. Tenant's obligations to pay fixed rent and additional rent shall survive the expiration of the Lease term or earlier termination of this Lease. 





 The provisions of this Article are in addition to all other rights or remedies available to Landlord for nonpayment of fixed rent or additional rent under this Lease and at law and in equity. Tenant further agrees that the Late Charge imposed is fair and reasonable, complies with all laws, regulations and statutes, and constitutes an agreement between Landlord and Tenant as to the estimated compensation for costs and administrative expenses incurred by Landlord due to the late payment of rent to Landlord by Tenant. Tenant further agrees that the Late Charge assessed pursuant to this Lease is not interest and the Late Charge assessed does not constitute a lender or borrower/creditor relationship between Landlord and Tenant or a penalty of any kind. It is understood that said late charge is directly related to Landlord’s actual costs and expenses incurred as a result of late payment. 



 All fixed rent and additional rent (collectively hereinafter referred to as ""rent"") shall be paid in such coin or currency (or, subject to collection, by good check payable in such coin or currency) of the United States of America as at the time shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, at the office of Landlord as set forth above, or at such place and to such person as Landlord from time to time may designate. 



 All rent shall be paid to Landlord without notice, demand, counterclaim, setoff, deduction or defense, and nothing shall suspend, defer, diminish, abate, or reduce any rent, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Lease or by law. 



 Tenant shall make all rental payments in full. Payment or receipt of a rental payment of less than the amount stated in this Lease shall be deemed to be nothing more than partial payment on account. Under no circumstances shall Landlord’s acceptance of a partial payment constitute accord and satisfaction. Nor will Landlord’s acceptance of a partial payment forfeit Landlord’s right to collect the balance due on the account, together with applicable late charges and interest despite any endorsement, stipulation, or other statement on any check. 



 Landlord may accept any partial payment check with any conditional endorsement without prejudice to its right to recover the balance remaining due, or to pursue any other remedy available under this Lease, law or equity. 



 Landlord in its sole discretion may allocate without prejudice any payment in whole or in part to any due item of fixed rent, additional rent and/or any other charges or to any combination thereof. 



 If Landlord commences any action or proceeding against Tenant, or if Landlord is required to defend any action or proceeding commenced by Tenant, in connection with this lease or the Premises, and Landlord shall be the prevailing party in any such action for proceeding, Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant in such action or proceeding, or a subsequently commenced action or proceeding, Landlord's reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements and all applicable interest thereon at the statutory rate incurred in connection with such action or proceeding and any appeals, including but not limited to fees on fees incurred to collect said monies. 



 Landlord’s failure during the Lease term to prepare and deliver any of the statements, notices, or bills for rent and/or additional rent or Landlord’s failure to make a demand, shall not in any way cause Landlord to forfeit or surrender its rights to collect any of the items of rent and/or additional rent that may have become due during the term of this Lease. Tenant’s liability for all such amounts due under this Lease shall survive the expiration of the Term.

 “Taxes” shall mean the total of all real estate taxes and assessments and special assessments imposed, payable and paid upon the Premises described as the land and building in which the Premises are located including, without limitation, vault taxes, rents or charges, imposed by any Governmental Authority, of which the demised Premises forms a part. If at any time during the term of this Lease the methods of taxation prevailing at the commencement of the term hereof shall be altered so that in lieu of or as a substitute for the whole or any part of the taxes, assessments, levies, impositions of charges now levied, assessed or imposed on the real estate and the improvements thereon, there shall be levied, assessed or imposed (i) a tax, assessment, levy imposition or charge wholly or partially as capital levy or otherwise on the rents received therefrom, or (ii) a tax assessment levy upon the Building, Land Improvements or the Premises and imposed upon Landlord, or (iii) a license fee measured by the rents payable, or the part thereof so measured or based shall be deemed to be included within the term ""Taxes"" for the purposes hereof. 



 ""Escalation Year"" shall mean each twelve month period or portion thereof, ending on June 30, occurring within the term of this Lease. 



 ""Base Year"" shall mean the twelve month period ending on June 30, 2022. 



 ""Base Year Taxes"" shall mean the Taxes for the Base Year. 



 The ""building"" shall mean the land and the building of which the demised Premises forms a part. ""Tenant's Share"" shall mean 35%. 

 Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as additional rent, an amount equal to Tenant's Share of the amount by which Taxes for any Escalation Year during the term of this Lease exceed the Base Year Taxes. 



 Landlord shall submit to Tenant a statement setting forth the computation of the amount of such excess Taxes and Tenant's Share of each thereof including copies of applicable tax bills. Tenant shall pay Tenant's Share of such excess amount of Taxes within ten days after the rendition of such statement which shall separately calculate Tenant’s Share, however, the payment of Tenant's Share shall not be due earlier than 10 days before the corresponding Taxes are due to the taxing authority.

 41.  The computations under this Article 41 are intended to constitute a formula for an agreed rental escalation and do not necessarily constitute an actual reimbursement to Landlord for costs or expenses paid by Landlord with respect to the building.

"(B)  choose either Landlord's determination or Tenant's determination submitted to the Appraiser as the better estimate of Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent, being the determination which is closer to the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent determined by the Appraiser using the definition set forth in this Article 72, within thirty (30) days after the date that the Appraiser is designated. The Appraiser's aforesaid choice shall be conclusive and binding upon Landlord and Tenant. Each party shall pay its own counsel fees and expenses, if any, in connection with the procedure described herein, and fifty (50%) percent of any AAA fees and fees of the Appraiser. Either Landlord or Tenant shall have the right to submit to the Appraiser any material in support of its determination of Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent within ten (10) business days of the date of the selection of the Appraiser. After a determination has been made of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent, the parties shall execute and deliver a lease amendment memorializing the extension of the Term as described in this Article 72 and setting forth the Rent payable by Tenant during the Renewal Term, but the failure to so execute and deliver any such instrument shall not affect the determination of Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent (and, accordingly, the Rent payable during the Renewal Term). 





 (iii) If Tenant timely disputes Landlord’s Determination and if the final determination of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent shall not be made on or before the first day of the subject Renewal Term then, pending such final determination, Tenant shall pay, as Rent for the subject Renewal Term, an amount equal to Landlord’s Determination. If, based upon the final determination of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent, the Rent payments made by Tenant for such portion of the subject Renewal Term were (i) less than they should have been, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord the amount of such deficiency within ten (10) business days after demand therefor, or (ii) greater than they should have been, then Landlord shall credit the amount of such excess against installments of Rent next coming due. 



         Time shall be of the essence with respect to all obligations under this Article 72.

"ASSIGNMENT OR SUBLETTING.

                         6.1 General; Definition of Transfer. Neither Tenant nor Tenant's legal representatives or successors in interest by operation of law or otherwise shall transfer this Lease except as provided in this article. For purposes of this article, a ""transfer"" shall mean any of the following: (a) an assignment of this Lease; (b) a collateral assignment, mortgage, or other encumbrance involving this Lease; (c) a sublease, license agreement, or other agreement permitting all or any portion of the Premises to be used by others; (d) a reduction of Tenant's assets to the point that this Lease is substantially Tenant's only asset; (e) a change or conversion in the form of entity of Tenant or any transferee or any entity controlling any of them which has the effect of limiting the liability of any of the partners, members, or other owners of the entity; (f) the agreement by a third party to assume, take over, or reimburse Tenant for any of Tenant's obligations under this Lease in order to induce Tenant to lease space from the third party; or (g) any transfer of direct or indirect control of Tenant, which shall be defined as any issuance or transfer of stock in any corporate tenant or subtenant or any interest in any non- corporation entity tenant or subtenant, by sale, exchange, merger, consolidation, operation of law, or otherwise, or creation of new stock or interests, by which an aggregate of 50% or more of Tenant's stock or equity interests shall be vested in one or more parties who are not stockholders or interest holders as of the Date of this Lease, or any transfer of the power to direct the operations of any entity (by equity ownership, contract, or otherwise), to one or more parties who are not stockholders or interest holders as of the Date of this Lease, however accomplished, and whether in a single transaction or in a series of related or unrelated transactions. This section shall not apply to sales of stock by persons other than those deemed ""insiders"" within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, which sales are effected through any recognized securities exchange. Any modification or amendment to any sublease of any portion of the Premises shall be deemed a further sublease of this Lease. As used in this article, the term ""transferee"" shall include any assignee or subtenant of Tenant or any other party involved in any of the other transactions or events constituting a transfer. Consent by Landlord to a transfer shall not relieve Tenant from the obligation to obtain Landlord's written consent to any further transfer. Any transfer by Tenant in violation of this article shall be void and shall constitute a default under this Lease.

                         6.2 Request for Consent. If Tenant requests Landlord's consent to a transfer, it shall submit in writing to Landlord, not later than 30 days before any anticipated transfer, (a) the name and address of the proposed transferee, (b) a duly executed counterpart of the proposed transfer agreement, (c) reasonably satisfactory information as to the nature and character of the business of the proposed transferee, as to the nature and character of its proposed use of the space, and otherwise responsive to the criteria set forth in the Reasonable Consent section of this article, and (d) banking, financial, or other credit information relating to the proposed transferee reasonably sufficient to enable Landlord to determine the financial responsibility and character of the proposed transferee, including balance sheets and profit and loss statements for the transferee covering the three years before the transfer, certified by the transferee, and a list of personal, banking, business, and credit references for the transferee.

                         6.3 Recapture. Landlord shall have the following options to be exercised within 15 Business Days from submission of Tenant's request for Landlord's consent to a specific transfer: (i) If Tenant proposes to assign this Lease or sublet all or substantially all of the Premises, Landlord shall have the option to cancel and terminate this Lease as of the proposed commencement date for the transfer, and (ii) If Tenant proposes to sublet less than all or substantially all of the Premises or if a proposed sublease shall be for less than the balance of the Lease Term, Landlord shall have the option of canceling and terminating this Lease only as to the applicable portion of the Premises and the applicable portion of the Lease Term covered by the proposed sublease, effective as of the proposed commencement date of the sublease. If Landlord exercises this option, all Rent for the Premises shall be equitably apportioned as of the commencement date of the sublease and Landlord, at Tenant's expense, shall perform all work and make all alterations as may be required to physically separate the applicable portion of the Premises from the remainder of the Premises and to permit lawful occupancy of the separated portion.

                         6.4 Reasonable Consent. If Landlord does not elect either of the options provided in the Recapture section of this article, Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to a proposed transfer. It shall be deemed reasonable for Landlord to withhold consent to any proposed transfer if any of the following conditions have not been established to Landlord's satisfaction:

                                 6.4.1 The proposed transferee has sufficient financial wherewithal to discharge its obligations under this Lease as determined by Landlord's criteria for selecting Project tenants and has a tangible net worth, experience, and reputation that is not less than the tangible net worth, experience, and reputation of Tenant on the Date of this Lease or the date of the transfer, whichever is greater. ""Tangible net worth"" shall mean the excess of the value of tangible assets (i.e. assets excluding those which are intangible such as goodwill, patents and trademarks) over liabilities.

                                 6.4.2 The use, nature, business, activities, or reputation in the business community of the proposed transferee will not cause physical harm to the Project or harm to the reputation of the Project that would result in an impairment of Landlord's ability to lease space in the Project or a diminution in the rental value of space in the Project.

                                 6.4.3 The proposed use of the Premises by the proposed transferee will be the Permitted Use and not prohibited by the Rules and Regulations, and will not violate any restrictive covenants or exclusive use provisions applicable to Landlord, cause a violation of another lease for space in the Project, or give an occupant of the Project a right to cancel its lease.

                                 6.4.4 The proposed transferee shall not be any person or entity who shall at that time be a tenant, subtenant, or other occupant of any part of the Project, or an affiliate of any of them, or who dealt with Landlord or Landlord's agent (directly or through a broker) as to space in the Project during the six months immediately preceding Tenant's request for Landlord's consent.

                                 6.4.5 The proposed use of the Premises by the proposed transferee will not require alterations or additions to the Premises or the Project to comply with applicable law or governmental requirements and will not negatively affect insurance requirements or involve the introduction of materials to the Premises that are not in compliance with applicable environmental laws.

                                 6.4.6 Any mortgagee of the Project will consent to the proposed transfer if such consent is required under the relevant loan documents.

                                 6.4.7 The proposed use of the Premises will not materially increase the operating costs for the Project or the burden on Project services, or generate excessive foot traffic, elevator usage, Parking Area usage, or security concerns in the Project, or compromise or reduce the comfort or safety, or both, of Landlord and the other occupants of the Project.

                                 6.4.8 The proposed transferee shall not be, and shall not be affiliated with, anyone with whom Landlord or any of its affiliates or mortgagees has been involved with in litigation or who has defaulted under any agreement with Landlord or any of its affiliates.

                                 6.4.9 There shall be no default by Tenant, beyond any applicable grace period, under any of the terms, covenants, and conditions of this Lease at the time that Landlord's consent to a transfer is requested and on the date of the commencement of the term of the proposed transfer.

                                 6.4.10 If the resulting tenant entity does not have equal or greater tangible net worth and creditworthiness as Tenant as of the Date of this Lease or the date of transfer, whichever is greater, Landlord, at its option, may approve the transfer subject to an increase in the Security Deposit, or receipt of new personal guarantees acceptable to Landlord, or both.

                                 6.4.11 Any Guarantor will consent to the transfer and to execute a written agreement reaffirming the",Transfer Restrictions,Assignment or Subleasing

Upon the completion or abandonment of the Purpose, and in any event upon the disclosing party’s request, the receiving party will promptly return to the disclosing party all tangible items and embodiments containing or consisting of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information and all copies thereof (including electronic copies), and any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations, memoranda or other documents (regardless of the form thereof) prepared by or on behalf of the receiving party that contain or are based upon the disclosing party’s Confidential Information.

9.        Equitable Relief.

Accordingly, each party agrees that the disclosing party will have the right to seek immediate equitable relief to enjoin any unauthorized use or disclosure of its Confidential Information, in addition to any other rights and remedies that it may have at law or otherwise.

41. Escalations 



 Tenant shall pay, during the term of this Lease, the additional rent provided for in this Article 41. As used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below: 



 “Taxes” shall mean the total of all real estate taxes and assessments and special assessments imposed, payable and paid upon the Premises described as the land and building in which the Premises are located including, without limitation, vault taxes, rents or charges, imposed by any Governmental Authority, of which the demised Premises forms a part. If at any time during the term of this Lease the methods of taxation prevailing at the commencement of the term hereof shall be altered so that in lieu of or as a substitute for the whole or any part of the taxes, assessments, levies, impositions of charges now levied, assessed or imposed on the real estate and the improvements thereon, there shall be levied, assessed or imposed (i) a tax, assessment, levy imposition or charge wholly or partially as capital levy or otherwise on the rents received therefrom, or (ii) a tax assessment levy upon the Building, Land Improvements or the Premises and imposed upon Landlord, or (iii) a license fee measured by the rents payable, or the part thereof so measured or based shall be deemed to be included within the term ""Taxes"" for the purposes hereof. 



 ""Escalation Year"" shall mean each twelve month period or portion thereof, ending on June 30, occurring within the term of this Lease. 



 ""Base Year"" shall mean the twelve month period ending on June 30, 2022. 



 ""Base Year Taxes"" shall mean the Taxes for the Base Year. 



 The ""building"" shall mean the land and the building of which the demised Premises forms a part. ""Tenant's Share"" shall mean 35%. 

 Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as additional rent, an amount equal to Tenant's Share of the amount by which Taxes for any Escalation Year during the term of this Lease exceed the Base Year Taxes. 



 Landlord shall submit to Tenant a statement setting forth the computation of the amount of such excess Taxes and Tenant's Share of each thereof including copies of applicable tax bills. Tenant shall pay Tenant's Share of such excess amount of Taxes within ten days after the rendition of such statement which shall separately calculate Tenant’s Share, however, the payment of Tenant's Share shall not be due earlier than 10 days before the corresponding Taxes are due to the taxing authority. 



         In no event shall the annual fixed rent under this Lease be reduced by virtue of this Article 

 41.  The computations under this Article 41 are intended to constitute a formula for an agreed rental escalation and do not necessarily constitute an actual reimbursement to Landlord for costs or expenses paid by Landlord with respect to the building. 





 Upon the date of the expiration of the Lease term or earlier termination of this Lease, a proportionate share of the additional rent payable under this Article 41 for the Escalation Year during which such expiration or termination occurs shall immediately become due and payable by Tenant to Landlord. Said proportionate share shall be based on the length of time that the term of this Lease shall be within such Escalation Year. Promptly after such expiration or termination, Landlord shall compute the additional rent due from Tenant, as aforesaid, which computation shall be an estimate based upon the most recent annual statements theretofore furnished by Landlord to Tenant. Upon written request by Tenant, Landlord shall cause a final statement showing the computation of the actual additional rent due from Tenant for that Escalation Year to be prepared and furnished to Tenant, whereupon any appropriate adjustments of 





 amount owed to Landlord shall be made. The obligations of Tenant to pay additional rent as provided for herein shall survive the expiration of the Lease term or earlier termination of this Lease. If Tenant continues in possession of the Premises after the expiration of the Lease term or earlier termination of this Lease, as a month to month tenant or otherwise, the provisions of this Article 41 shall continue in full force and effect for so long as Tenant remains in possession of the Premises. 



 The additional rent provided for herein shall be collectible by Landlord in the same manner as the regular installments of fixed rent due under this Lease. Notwithstanding anything set forth elsewhere in this Article or elsewhere in this Lease, no delay or failure by Landlord in preparing or delivering any statement or demand for any additional rent, including but not limited to the statements and/or demands provided for in this Article, shall constitute a waiver of, or impair Landlord's rights to collect, such additional rent. 



 The billing statements provided by Landlord for the charges due pursuant to this Article 41 shall constitute a final determination as between Landlord and Tenant of the additional rent for the periods represented thereby, unless Tenant within thirty days after they have been furnished shall give a written notice to Landlord that Tenant disputes their accuracy or appropriateness, which written notice shall specify the particular respects in which the statement is inaccurate or inappropriate. Pending the resolution of such dispute, Tenant shall pay the additional rent to Landlord in accordance with the statements furnished by Landlord. 



 In addition to Taxes as set forth above, Tenant shall pay within ten (10) days after invoice therefor,including copies of applicable bill, an amount equal to Tenant's Share of the amount by which any charges imposed by any Business Improvement District on the Premises or any Escalation Year during the term of this Lease exceed Business Improvement District Charges in the Base Year.",Lease Term and Escalations,Tax Escalation

"Assessment and Plan:

                 77 yo woman presents with significant angioedema in left side of tongue and inner cheek. Possible causes of angioedema include allergic anaphylaxis reaction, drug induced, allergic contact dermatitis, viral infection, drug induced, or a C1 inhibitor deficiency disorder acquired or hereditary. Laryngeal edema can also be caused by tonsillitis, peritonsilar abscess or pharyngeal foreign body.

                 It is unlikely that the patient has edema caused by abscess or tonsillitis since she does not have any associated fever or other signs of infection and the sudden onset of her swelling also argues against this. It is not likely a foreign body since ENT did not find anything when they scoped her.

                 It is unlikely that it is caused by a mast cell mediated etiologigy that increases vascular permeability through mast cell degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators include allergic angioedema, autoimmune mast cell release and direct mast cell release caused by medications such as opiates and radiocontrast media. It is not likely this type of reaction because these etiologies are associated with urticaria and pruritis, which the patient did not have. Also the patient did not have any exposure to a new pet, food, lotion or any other allergen or medication that could cause an allergic type reaction. The patient also does not have any history of autoimmune disease or any reaction similar to this in the past

                 It is more likely that the etiology is kinin-related where angioedema results from generation of bradykinin and complement-derived mediators that increase vascular permeability since there is no urticaria or pruritis. The most likely cause is the Altace (ACEI) that the patient has been taking caused an increase in bradykinin since it decreases angiotensin 2 which degrades bradykinin. Bradykinin can then interact with vascular receptors increasing vasodilation, vascular permeability, increased cGMP and release of nitric oxide. This reaction occurs in .1-7% of patients treated with an ACEI and it typically involves the mouth, lips, tounge, larynx, pharynx and sublottic tissues. Half of these cases usually occur within a week of starting the ACEI but can occur years later. This is a class specific reaction not a drug specific and ARBs can cause the same reaction even though these drugs don’t effect the kinin metabolism. 50% of patients with angioedema due to an ARB also had an ACEI induced angioedema (Cicardi, M, Zingale, LC, Bergamschini L, Agostoni, A. Angioedema associated with agniotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use: outcome after switching to a different treatment. Arch Intern Med 2004; 164:910). Deficiency of C1 inhibitor can cause angioedema since levels of complement are reduced and cause increased bradykinin. This can be due to lack of C1 INH or adequate amounts of nonfunctional C1 INH. Other causes of angioedema include aspirin and NSAIDs since inhibition of cox and enzyme pathyway increases formation of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes.

                 Other possibilities in the differential of causes of swelling include cellulitis, autoimmune conditions including SLE, polymyositis, dermatomyositis and sjorgren’s syndrome. Hypothyroidism can cuase puffiness of face and lips, hyperthyroidism can cause an infiltrative dermopathy, superior vena cava syndrome and tumors can cause venous engorgement and swelling. It is not likely one of these etiologies since the patient is on an ACEI and the swelling is restricted only to her tongue and throat typical of ACEI angioedema.",Treatment Plan,Angioedema Explanation

                             Section 1.1 Subject to the terms and provisions hereof, Shipper agrees to tender to Carrier an indeterminable number of Shipments (hereinafter defined) during the term of this Agreement, but not less than three

                 Section 1.3 Carrier shall furnish to Shipper a copy of the United States Department of Transportation General Motor Carrier Safety Administration Form MCS-150, Form MCS-90, and Form BMC-91X filed by Carrier as well

                          Section 1.4 When Shipper desires Carrier to transport a Shipment, Shipper will notify Carrier by e- mail, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), verbally and/or by facsimile, specifying the load, the destination, and the date by which the load must reach the destination. Carrier will either accept or reject the opportunity to transport the Shipment by return e-mail, EDI, and/or facsimile to the Shipper in Section 13.4. If Carrier accepts, Carrier will be bound by the terms of this Agreement with respect to each such Shipment. If Carrier rejects, the rejected load will be

The invoice will be due and payable thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the invoice, provided that on or before said date Shipper has received from Carrier (i) duly executed receipt(s) from whom delivery was made concerning the applicable invoice, and (ii) such other supporting materials as Shipper may reasonably require.

                 Section 2.4 Carrier shall maintain complete and accurate records of each Shipment and all transactions under

                    this Agreement, including all supporting documentation and proof of delivery, and in a manner consistent with generally acceptable accounting procedures.

In exchange for Shipper’s guarantee of prompt payment, (i) agrees not to contact Shipper’s customers, consignors, consignees or any party other than Shipper

                      concerning payment for transportation services; and, (ii) agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Shipper, its customers, consignors, and consignees harmless from any claim or demand made by any subcontractor of Carrier or other party for payment for transportation services related to a shipment of cargo tendered under this Agreement.

                             Section 3.2 Any claim for overpayment or underpayment for transportation services provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be presented by the party asserting the claim to the other party within sixty (60) days of discovery of the claim, but in no event will any such claim(s) be asserted more than one hundred eighty

                                                           equipment or its operations.

"54. Insurance 



 Tenant, at all times during the term of this Lease and at Tenant's expense, shall provide and keep in force with insurers reasonably approved by Landlord Commercial General Liability insurance against all claims for personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occurring upon, in or about the Premises, such insurance (a) to be on an occurrence basis with a general aggregate of not less than 

 $3,000,000, including umbrella coverage, (b) to cover at least the following hazards (1) Premises and operations, including but not limited to flooding, backup of sewers and drains, burglary, theft, and plate glass (2) Tenant's independent contractors; (3) contractual liability for all written and oral contracts; and (4) contractual liability covering the indemnitees contained elsewhere in this Lease, and Liquor Law legal liability insurance. 



 All insurance maintained by Tenant pursuant to this Article shall name Landlord and Landlord’s managing agent as additional insureds and shall name Tenant as the insured, shall provide that any loss shall be payable notwithstanding any act or failure to act or negligence of Landlord, Tenant or any other person, shall provide that no cancellation, reduction in amount, or material change in coverage thereof will be effective until at least thirty days after mailing by the insurer to Landlord of written notice thereof, and shall be satisfactory to Landlord, acting reasonably, in all other respects. All insurance provided for herein shall be obtained under valid and enforceable policies, issued by financially sound and responsible insurance companies authorized, licensed and admitted to do business in the state in which the Premises and building are located and reasonably approved by Landlord. The insurance companies must have a general policy rating of A or better and a financial class of IX or better by AM Best Co., Inc. 



 Tenant hereby waives any and all rights of recovery against Landlord, its officers, members, agents, and employees, occurring on or arising out of the use and occupation of the Premises or the building to the extent such loss or damage is covered by proceeds received from insurance required under this Lease to be carried. This waiver of subrogation provision shall be limited to loss or damage to the property of Landlord and Tenant and bodily injury to employees, officers, agents of each party and any other injured member of the public. Tenant shall indemnify Landlord against any loss or expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from the failure to obtain such waiver. This waiver shall be in addition to, and not in limitation or derogation of, any other waiver or release contained in this Lease with respect to any loss of, or damage to, property of the parties hereto or bodily injury to either party or to members of the public. Inasmuch as the above waiver will preclude the assignment of any aforesaid claim by way of subrogation to an insurance company, Tenant agrees immediately to give to each insurance company providing a policy described in this Article, written notice of the terms of said waiver, and to have said insurance policies properly endorsed, if necessary, to prevent the invalidation of said insurance coverages by reason of said waiver. 



 Upon the execution of this Lease and thereafter not less than fifteen days prior to the expiration date of any policy delivered pursuant to this Article, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord the originals of all policies or renewal policies, as the case may be, required by this Lease, bearing notations evidencing the payment of the premiums therefor, which premiums may be paid by Tenant in installments if such payment of premiums by installments is provided for and permitted by such original or renewal policies . In lieu of any such policies, Tenant may deliver certificates of the insurer, in form and substance satisfactory to Landlord, as to the issuance and effectiveness of such policies and the amounts of coverage afforded thereby, accompanied by copies of such policies. Such insurance may be provided through a blanket policy or policies in form and substance satisfactory to Landlord. Such blanket policies shall provide specific allocation to the demised premises of the coverage afforded thereby, and shall give to Landlord no less protection than that which would be afforded by separate policies. 



 If at any time Tenant shall neglect or fail to provide or maintain insurance or to deliver insurance policies in accordance with this Article, Landlord may effect such insurance as agent for Tenant, by taking out policies in a company satisfactory to Landlord, and the amount of the premiums paid for such 





 insurance shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord on demand. Landlord, in addition to Landlord's other rights, powers and remedies, shall be entitled to recover as damages for any breach of this Article the uninsured amount of any liability, claim, loss, damage or expense, including reasonable attorneys' fees, suffered or incurred by Landlord, and shall not be limited in the proof of damages which Landlord may claim against Tenant to the amount of the insurance premiums not paid or incurred by Tenant which would have been payable for such insurance.",Commercial General Liability Insurance,Insurance

Tenant further agrees that the Late Charge imposed is fair and reasonable, complies with all laws, regulations and statutes, and constitutes an agreement between Landlord and Tenant as to the estimated compensation for costs and administrative expenses incurred by Landlord due to the late payment of rent to Landlord by Tenant. Tenant further agrees that the Late Charge assessed pursuant to this Lease is not interest and the Late Charge assessed does not constitute a lender or borrower/creditor relationship between Landlord and Tenant or a penalty of any kind.

"8. DEFAULT.

                         8.1 Events of Default. Each of the following shall be an event of default under this Lease: (a) Tenant fails to make any payment of Rent when due; (b) Tenant or any Guarantor for Tenant's obligations under this Lease becomes bankrupt or insolvent or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or takes the benefit of any insolvency act, or if any debtor proceedings are taken by or against Tenant or any Guarantor, or any Guarantor dies; (c) Tenant abandons the Premises; (d) Tenant transfers this Lease in violation of the Assignment or Subletting article; (e) Tenant fails to deliver an estoppel certificate or subordination agreement or maintain required insurance coverages within the time periods required by this Lease; (f) Tenant does not comply with its obligations to vacate the Premises under the End of Term article of this Lease; or (g) Tenant fails to perform any other obligation under this Lease.

                         8.2 Remedies. If Tenant defaults, in addition to all remedies provided by law, including the right to terminate this Lease, Landlord may declare the entire balance of all Rent due under this Lease for the remainder of the Lease Term to be forthwith due and payable and may collect the then present value of the Rents (calculated using a discount rate equal to the discount rate of the branch of the Federal Reserve Bank closest to the Premises in effect as of the date of the default). Tenant waives all rights of redemption or to prevent a forfeiture that it has under applicable law after this Lease has been terminated or Tenant has surrendered or abandoned the Premises or has been evicted or otherwise dispossessed from the Premises.

                         8.3 Landlord's Right to Perform. If Tenant defaults, Landlord may, but shall have no obligation to, perform the obligations of Tenant, and if Landlord, in doing so, makes any expenditures or incurs any obligation for the payment of money, including reasonable attorneys' fees, the sums so paid or obligations incurred shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord upon receipt of a bill or statement to Tenant therefor.

                         8.4 Late Charges, Interest, and Bad Checks. If any payment due Landlord shall not be paid within five days of the date when due, Tenant shall pay, in addition to the payment then due, an administrative charge equal to the greater of (a) 5% of the past due payment; or (b) $500. All payments due Landlord shall bear interest at the lesser of: (a) 18% per annum, or (b) the highest rate of interest permitted to be charged by applicable law, accruing from the date the obligation arose through the date payment is actually received by Landlord, including after the date of any judgment against Tenant. If any check given to Landlord for any payment is dishonored for any reason whatsoever not attributable to Landlord, in addition to all other remedies available to Landlord, upon demand, Tenant will reimburse Landlord for all insufficient funds, bank, or returned check fees, plus an administrative fee not to exceed the maximum amount prescribed by law. In addition, Landlord may require all future payments from Tenant to be made by ACH payments, or by Federal Reserve wire transfer to Landlord's account.

                         8.5 Limitations. None of the Landlord Parties shall ever have any personal liability to Tenant. No person holding Landlord's interest shall have any liability after such person ceases to hold such interest, except for any liability accruing while such person held such interest. TENANT SHALL LOOK SOLELY TO LANDLORD'S ESTATE AND INTEREST IN THE BUILDING FOR THE SATISFACTION OF ANY CLAIMS BY TENANT OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER ARISING FROM THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES OR ANY RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS THEY MAY HAVE RELATING TO THE PROJECT, THIS LEASE, OR ANYTHING RELATED TO EITHER, AND NO OTHER ASSETS OF LANDLORD SHALL BE SUBJECT TO LEVY, EXECUTION, OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE FOR THE SATISFACTION OF TENANT'S RIGHTS OR REMEDIES, OR ANY OTHER LIABILITY OF LANDLORD TO TENANT OF WHATEVER KIND OR NATURE. No act or omission of Landlord or its agents shall constitute an actual or constructive eviction of Tenant or a default by Landlord as to any of its obligations under this Lease unless Landlord shall have first received written notice from Tenant of the claimed default and shall have failed to cure it after having been afforded reasonable time in which to do so, which in no event shall be less than 30 days. Further, Tenant waives any claims against Landlord that Tenant does not make in writing within 30 days of the onset of the cause of such claim.

                         8.6 Presumption of Abandonment. It shall be conclusively presumed that Tenant has abandoned the Premises if Tenant fails to keep the Premises open for business during regular business hours for ten consecutive days while in monetary default. Any grace periods set forth in this article shall not apply to the application of this presumption.

                         8.7 Multiple Defaults.

 If Tenant timely exercises this Renewal Option, Landlord shall notify Tenant (the “Rent Notice”) at least one hundred twenty (120) days before the Expiration Date of Landlord’s determination of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent and Landlord’s calculation of the Rent payable during the first year of the Renewal Term and during each successive year of the Renewal Term in accordance with the formula set forth above (“Landlord’s Determination”). Tenant shall notify Landlord (“Tenant’s Notice”), within thirty (30) days after Tenant’s receipt of the Rent Notice, whether Tenant accepts or disputes Landlord’s Determination, and if Tenant disputes Landlord’s Determination, Tenant’s Notice shall set forth Tenant’s determination of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent and Tenant’s calculation of the Rent payable during the first year of the Renewal Term and during each successive year of the Renewal Term in accordance with the formula set forth above (“Tenant’s Determination”). If Tenant fails to give Tenant’s Notice within such thirty (30) day period, Tenant shall be deemed to have accepted Landlord’s Determination. 



 If Tenant timely disputes Landlord’s Determination and Landlord and Tenant fail to agree as to the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent (and, accordingly, the Rent payable by Tenant during the subject Renewal Term) within thirty (30) days after the giving of Tenant’s Notice, then the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent shall be determined as follows: A licensed real estate appraiser (the “Appraiser”) shall be selected and paid for jointly by Landlord and Tenant. If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree upon the Appraiser, then the same shall be designated by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The Appraiser selected by the parties or designated by the AAA shall have at least ten (10) years’ experience in the appraisal of retail space in Manhattan, NY. Landlord and Tenant shall each submit to the Appraiser and to the other its determination of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent. The parties shall instruct the Appraiser to (A) conduct the hearings and investigations that he or she deems appropriate, and 

 (B)  choose either Landlord's determination or Tenant's determination submitted to the Appraiser as the better estimate of Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent, being the determination which is closer to the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent determined by the Appraiser using the definition set forth in this Article 72, within thirty (30) days after the date that the Appraiser is designated. The Appraiser's aforesaid choice shall be conclusive and binding upon Landlord and Tenant. Each party shall pay its own counsel fees and expenses, if any, in connection with the procedure described herein, and fifty (50%) percent of any AAA fees and fees of the Appraiser. Either Landlord or Tenant shall have the right to submit to the Appraiser any material in support of its determination of Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent within ten (10) business days of the date of the selection of the Appraiser. After a determination has been made of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent, the parties shall execute and deliver a lease amendment memorializing the extension of the Term as described in this Article 72 and setting forth the Rent payable by Tenant during the Renewal Term, but the failure to so execute and deliver any such instrument shall not affect the determination of Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent (and, accordingly, the Rent payable during the Renewal Term). 





 (iii) If Tenant timely disputes Landlord’s Determination and if the final determination of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent shall not be made on or before the first day of the subject Renewal Term then, pending such final determination, Tenant shall pay, as Rent for the subject Renewal Term, an amount equal to Landlord’s Determination. If, based upon the final determination of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent, the Rent payments made by Tenant for such portion of the subject Renewal Term were (i) less than they should have been, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord the amount of such deficiency within ten (10) business days after demand therefor, or (ii) greater than they should have been, then Landlord shall credit the amount of such excess against installments of Rent next coming due. 



         Time shall be of the essence with respect to all obligations under this Article 72.

              3.1. Study Rationale

              A prandial insulin with faster-on and/or faster-off characteristics might reduce glycemic excursions and the incidence of postprandial hypoglycemia compared to currently available fast-acting insulin analogs. LY900014 is an ultra-rapid-acting insulin lispro formulation that has shown an increased early absorption compared to commercially available insulin lispro (Humalog®; Eli Lilly). LY900014 aims to closely mimic the physiological prandial insulin secretion pattern, which may more effectively control postprandial glucose excursions and allow increased flexibility of the time of dosing relative to a meal.

              This study aims to compare PK and PD profiles as well as the improved action of insulin lispro from LY900014 on the control of postprandial blood glucose in comparison to Humalog in patients with T1DM. The improved action of insulin lispro will be assessed by using standardized mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTTs). Furthermore, this study will explore the postprandial glucose profiles with LY900014 and Humalog injected at two different meal-to- dose time intervals either immediately before or 20 minutes following the start of the test meal, to optimize future use of this investigational medicinal product (IMP).

              3.2. Background

              The insulin analog insulin lispro (Humalog) has been shown to be absorbed more quickly than regular human insulin (Humalog package insert, 2015). In healthy volunteers given subcutaneous (SC) doses of insulin lispro ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 units (U)/kg, peak serum levels were seen 30 to 90 minutes after dosing (Humalog package insert, 2015). However, the general consensus is that rapid-acting insulin is still not rapid enough to match carbohydrate absorption profiles, which limits efficacy and dosing flexibility. An ultra-rapid-acting prandial insulin would shift the PK/GD of insulin analogs so that they have an even faster onset to better match carbohydrate absorption and also allow greater flexibility in the time of dosing relative to meals.

              LY900014 represents a new formulation that contains insulin lispro, treprostinil, citrate and other excipients. This formulation involves the novel use of a microdose of treprostinil ( C ) as an excipient to enhance the absorption of insulin lispro by local vasodilatation rather than as C an active pharmaceutical ingredient to elicit a systemic effect. Treprostinil is a prostacyclin analogue, administered either through inhalation ( C ), as an intravenous (IV) infusion or as a continuous SC administration for the treatment of symptomatic C pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and has been approved in the US since 2002 and in Germany since 2006 (AMIS database [WWW]). Sodium citrate, an excipient that speeds insulin absorption (at least in part by enhancing vascular permeability), is also included in the formulation to further enhance the absorption of insulin lispro. Each of the other excipients (such as magnesium chloride) in the LY900014 formulation is listed in the US Food and Drug Administration

              (FDA)’s Generally Recognized as Safe Food Additives database and in the FDA’s Inactive Ingredients in Approved Drugs database. Furthermore, the excipient concentration in LY900014 is within the limits identified for approved drug products in the FDA Inactive Ingredients in Approved Drugs database. To date, LY900014 has been administered to approximately 89 patients with diabetes (60 T1DM and 29 T2DM) across 3 Phase 1b studies and approximately 107 healthy volunteers across these Phase 1 studies. The total insulin lispro exposure was similar between LY900014 and Humalog; however LY900014 demonstrated a faster and earlier insulin lispro absorption compared to Humalog. Additionally, through the use of multiple daily injections of LY900014 for up to 2 weeks in patients with either T1DM or T2DM, it was found that LY900014 was well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study treatment or discontinuations from the studies because of a drug-related adverse event (AE). Small numbers of treatment-emergent adverse events were reported, and there were no notable increases in these events in relation to any of the LY900014 formulations compared to those in relation to Humalog. There were no reported cases of severe hypoglycemia. Additionally, there was no reported incidences of local or systemic allergic reactions.

              3.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment

              This study will not offer any direct benefits to the patients participating in the study. The data from previous studies in healthy patients and patients with T1DM and T2DM have shown that LY900014 was well tolerated and the adverse drug reactions are in keeping with those reported for Humalog.

              Potential risks associated with LY900014, derived from the known risks of insulin lispro (Humalog), are hypoglycemia, hypersensitivity reactions (localized allergy and/or systemic allergy), undesirable effects at the injection site (injection-site reactions and lipodystrophy), and peripheral edema (Humalog package insert, 2015).

              Notably, across all doses in the studies that have evaluated treprostinil ( CCI ) as a local vasodilator with or without insulin lispro, there was no clinically significant increase in those AEs associated with systemic absorption of treprostinil, as described in the CCI package insert (2014). The exposures of treprostinil in LY900014 in this study are expected to be undetectable compared to those observed in the dose ranges previously explored with SC bolus administration of treprostinil and are expected to be substantially lower than those observed in the treatment of PAH. No known potential risks are associated with the use of small amounts of treprostinil in the LY900014 formulation.

              In preclinical safety pharmacology and toxicity studies, or clinical pharmacology studies involving LY900014 or treprostinil alone, other than known risks associated with Humalog and CCI , no additional risks were identified. Additionally, local and systemic toxicity profiles of Humalog and CCI do not suggest the potential for additive or synergistic toxicity

              The study includes inpatient procedures during which participants will be continuously monitored. Patients will be without food intake from the start of the MMTT to completion of blood collection (approximately 420 minutes) unless required to treat hypoglycemia, (see Section

              9.5.6.2 for definition of hypoglycemia and Section 9.5.8 for treatment guidelines). If a patient experiences elevated blood glucose following food intake for more than 1 hour, insulin glulisine will be administered intravenously (see Section 9.5.8 for treatment guidelines). Patients will maintain their basal insulin regimen of site-provided insulin glargine during the entire study including the MMTT days unless safety issues arise; in this case, the investigator will discuss a change of the basal insulin regimen with the sponsor clinical pharmacologist (CP) and implement this change, if necessary, to prevent any medical problems.

              More information about the known and expected benefits, risks, serious adverse events (SAEs) and reasonably anticipated adverse events (AEs) of LY900014 are to be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).

 Tenant hereby waives any and all rights of recovery against Landlord, its officers, members, agents, and employees, occurring on or arising out of the use and occupation of the Premises or the building to the extent such loss or damage is covered by proceeds received from insurance required under this Lease to be carried. This waiver of subrogation provision shall be limited to loss or damage to the property of Landlord and Tenant and bodily injury to employees, officers, agents of each party and any other injured member of the public. Tenant shall indemnify Landlord against any loss or expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from the failure to obtain such waiver.

Inasmuch as the above waiver will preclude the assignment of any aforesaid claim by way of subrogation to an insurance company, Tenant agrees immediately to give to each insurance company providing a policy described in this Article, written notice of the terms of said waiver, and to have said insurance policies properly endorsed, if necessary, to prevent the invalidation of said insurance coverages by reason of said waiver. 



 Upon the execution of this Lease and thereafter not less than fifteen days prior to the expiration date of any policy delivered pursuant to this Article, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord the originals of all policies or renewal policies, as the case may be, required by this Lease, bearing notations evidencing the payment of the premiums therefor, which premiums may be paid by Tenant in installments if such payment of premiums by installments is provided for and permitted by such original or renewal policies .

Such insurance may be provided through a blanket policy or policies in form and substance satisfactory to Landlord. Such blanket policies shall provide specific allocation to the demised premises of the coverage afforded thereby, and shall give to Landlord no less protection than that which would be afforded by separate policies. 



 If at any time Tenant shall neglect or fail to provide or maintain insurance or to deliver insurance policies in accordance with this Article, Landlord may effect such insurance as agent for Tenant, by taking out policies in a company satisfactory to Landlord, and the amount of the premiums paid for such 





 insurance shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord on demand. Landlord, in addition to Landlord's other rights, powers and remedies, shall be entitled to recover as damages for any breach of this Article the uninsured amount of any liability, claim, loss, damage or expense, including reasonable attorneys' fees, suffered or incurred by Landlord, and shall not be limited in the proof of damages which Landlord may claim against Tenant to the amount of the insurance premiums not paid or incurred by Tenant which would have been payable for such insurance.",Tenant Insurance Requirements,Insurance Coverage Details

"77 yo woman presents with significant angioedema in left side of tongue and inner cheek. Possible causes of angioedema include allergic anaphylaxis reaction, drug induced, allergic contact dermatitis, viral infection, drug induced, or a C1 inhibitor deficiency disorder acquired or hereditary. Laryngeal edema can also be caused by tonsillitis, peritonsilar abscess or pharyngeal foreign body.

                 It is unlikely that the patient has edema caused by abscess or tonsillitis since she does not have any associated fever or other signs of infection and the sudden onset of her swelling also argues against this. It is not likely a foreign body since ENT did not find anything when they scoped her.

                 It is unlikely that it is caused by a mast cell mediated etiologigy that increases vascular permeability through mast cell degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators include allergic angioedema, autoimmune mast cell release and direct mast cell release caused by medications such as opiates and radiocontrast media. It is not likely this type of reaction because these etiologies are associated with urticaria and pruritis, which the patient did not have. Also the patient did not have any exposure to a new pet, food, lotion or any other allergen or medication that could cause an allergic type reaction. The patient also does not have any history of autoimmune disease or any reaction similar to this in the past

                 It is more likely that the etiology is kinin-related where angioedema results from generation of bradykinin and complement-derived mediators that increase vascular permeability since there is no urticaria or pruritis. The most likely cause is the Altace (ACEI) that the patient has been taking caused an increase in bradykinin since it decreases angiotensin 2 which degrades bradykinin. Bradykinin can then interact with vascular receptors increasing vasodilation, vascular permeability, increased cGMP and release of nitric oxide. This reaction occurs in .1-7% of patients treated with an ACEI and it typically involves the mouth, lips, tounge, larynx, pharynx and sublottic tissues. Half of these cases usually occur within a week of starting the ACEI but can occur years later. This is a class specific reaction not a drug specific and ARBs can cause the same reaction even though these drugs don’t effect the kinin metabolism. 50% of patients with angioedema due to an ARB also had an ACEI induced angioedema (Cicardi, M, Zingale, LC, Bergamschini L, Agostoni, A. Angioedema associated with agniotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use: outcome after switching to a different treatment. Arch Intern Med 2004; 164:910). Deficiency of C1 inhibitor can cause angioedema since levels of complement are reduced and cause increased bradykinin. This can be due to lack of C1 INH or adequate amounts of nonfunctional C1 INH. Other causes of angioedema include aspirin and NSAIDs since inhibition of cox and enzyme pathyway increases formation of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes.

                 Other possibilities in the differential of causes of swelling include cellulitis, autoimmune conditions including SLE, polymyositis, dermatomyositis and sjorgren’s syndrome. Hypothyroidism can cuase puffiness of face and lips, hyperthyroidism can cause an infiltrative dermopathy, superior vena cava syndrome and tumors can cause venous engorgement and swelling. It is not likely one of these etiologies since the patient is on an ACEI and the swelling is restricted only to her tongue and throat typical of ACEI angioedema.",Allergic Angioedema,Angioedema Explanation

"Reasonable Consent. If Landlord does not elect either of the options provided in the Recapture section of this article, Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to a proposed transfer. It shall be deemed reasonable for Landlord to withhold consent to any proposed transfer if any of the following conditions have not been established to Landlord's satisfaction:

                                 6.4.1 The proposed transferee has sufficient financial wherewithal to discharge its obligations under this Lease as determined by Landlord's criteria for selecting Project tenants and has a tangible net worth, experience, and reputation that is not less than the tangible net worth, experience, and reputation of Tenant on the Date of this Lease or the date of the transfer, whichever is greater. ""Tangible net worth"" shall mean the excess of the value of tangible assets (i.e. assets excluding those which are intangible such as goodwill, patents and trademarks) over liabilities.

                                 6.4.2 The use, nature, business, activities, or reputation in the business community of the proposed transferee will not cause physical harm to the Project or harm to the reputation of the Project that would result in an impairment of Landlord's ability to lease space in the Project or a diminution in the rental value of space in the Project.

                                 6.4.3 The proposed use of the Premises by the proposed transferee will be the Permitted Use and not prohibited by the Rules and Regulations, and will not violate any restrictive covenants or exclusive use provisions applicable to Landlord, cause a violation of another lease for space in the Project, or give an occupant of the Project a right to cancel its lease.

                                 6.4.4 The proposed transferee shall not be any person or entity who shall at that time be a tenant, subtenant, or other occupant of any part of the Project, or an affiliate of any of them, or who dealt with Landlord or Landlord's agent (directly or through a broker) as to space in the Project during the six months immediately preceding Tenant's request for Landlord's consent.

                                 6.4.5 The proposed use of the Premises by the proposed transferee will not require alterations or additions to the Premises or the Project to comply with applicable law or governmental requirements and will not negatively affect insurance requirements or involve the introduction of materials to the Premises that are not in compliance with applicable environmental laws.

                                 6.4.6 Any mortgagee of the Project will consent to the proposed transfer if such consent is required under the relevant loan documents.

                                 6.4.7 The proposed use of the Premises will not materially increase the operating costs for the Project or the burden on Project services, or generate excessive foot traffic, elevator usage, Parking Area usage, or security concerns in the Project, or compromise or reduce the comfort or safety, or both, of Landlord and the other occupants of the Project.

                                 6.4.8 The proposed transferee shall not be, and shall not be affiliated with, anyone with whom Landlord or any of its affiliates or mortgagees has been involved with in litigation or who has defaulted under any agreement with Landlord or any of its affiliates.

                                 6.4.9 There shall be no default by Tenant, beyond any applicable grace period, under any of the terms, covenants, and conditions of this Lease at the time that Landlord's consent to a transfer is requested and on the date of the commencement of the term of the proposed transfer.

                                 6.4.10 If the resulting tenant entity does not have equal or greater tangible net worth and creditworthiness as Tenant as of the Date of this Lease or the date of transfer, whichever is greater, Landlord, at its option, may approve the transfer subject to an increase in the Security Deposit, or receipt of new personal guarantees acceptable to Landlord, or both.

"12. COMMON AREAS. The ""Common Areas"" of the Project include such areas and facilities as delivery facilities, walkways, landscaped and planted areas, a conference center, a fitness center, and parking facilities and are those areas designated by Landlord for the general use in common of occupants of the Project, including Tenant. The Common Areas shall at all times be subject to the exclusive control and management of Landlord. Landlord may charge Tenant a Building Standard fee for Tenant's exclusive temporary use of any Common Areas such as delivery facilities. Landlord may grant third parties specific rights concerning portions of the Common Areas. Landlord may, without it constituting an actual or constructive eviction, and without otherwise incurring any liability to Tenant, increase, reduce, improve, or otherwise alter the Common Areas, otherwise make improvements, alterations, additions, or reductions to the Project, and change the name or number by which the Building or Project is known. Landlord may also temporarily close the Common Areas to make repairs or improvements. Landlord has the right, but not the obligation, in its sole and absolute discretion, to temporarily close the Building or access to portions thereof, including any Common Area and the Premises, if there is any act or threat of any act of terrorism, war, violence, vandalism, civil unrest, riot, pandemic or health emergency, or other event that may pose a threat to the public health or safety or damage to the Building, including a hurricane warning, any advisory warning, directive, or notice from the Office of Homeland Security, the Center for Disease Control, or any other federal, state, or local governmental or enforcement agency (any of the foregoing, “Civil Unrest”). Tenant shall comply with any notice from Landlord or any governmental agency to close the Building or portions thereof and to immediately cause all of its employees, agents, contactors, and invitees to vacate the Building. Landlord will not be responsible for any loss or damage to Tenant’s business as a result, and Tenant will not be entitled to any abatement in rent or other relief of its obligations under this Lease for any period of time when Tenant may not have access to the Premises or Building due to any Civil Unrest or Landlord’s exercise of any of its other rights under this section. This Lease does not create, nor will Tenant have any express or implied easement for, or other rights to, air, light, or view over, from, or about the Project.

                13. SECURITY INTEREST. As security for Tenant's obligations under this Lease, Tenant grants to Landlord a security interest in this Lease and all property of Tenant now or hereafter placed in or upon the Premises including, all fixtures, furniture, inventory, machinery, equipment, merchandise, furnishings, and other articles of personal property, and all insurance proceeds of or relating to Tenant's property and all accessions and additions to, substitutions for, and replacements, products, and proceeds of the Tenant's property. This Lease constitutes a security agreement under the Florida Uniform Commercial Code. This security interest shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease and Landlord may, at any time, file a financing statement with the appropriate state or governmental agency with respect to such interest.

                14. CASUALTY DAMAGE. If the Project or any portion of it is damaged or destroyed by any casualty and: (a) the Building or Project or a material part of the Common Areas shall be so damaged that substantial alteration or reconstruction shall, in Landlord's opinion, be required (whether or not the Premises shall have been damaged by the casualty); or (b) Landlord is not permitted to rebuild the Building or Project or a material part of the Common Areas in substantially the same form as it existed before the damage; or (c) the Premises shall be materially damaged by casualty during the last two years of the Lease Term; or (d) any mortgagee requires that the insurance proceeds be applied to the payment of the mortgage debt; or (e) the damage is not fully covered by insurance maintained by Landlord; then Landlord may, within 90 days after the casualty, give notice to Tenant of Landlord's election to terminate this Lease, and the balance of the Lease Term shall automatically expire on the fifth day after the notice is delivered. If Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease, provided that Tenant was operating from the Premises immediately prior to the casualty and will recommence operations after restoration of the Premises, Landlord shall proceed with reasonable diligence to restore the Building and the Premises to substantially the same condition they were in immediately before the casualty. However, Landlord shall not be required to restore any unleased premises in the Building or any portion of Tenant's property. Rent shall abate in proportion to the portion of the Premises not usable by Tenant as a result of any casualty resulting in damage to the Building which is covered by insurance carried or required to be carried by Landlord under this Lease, as of the date on which the Premises becomes unusable and the abatement shall continue until the date the Premises become tenantable again. Landlord shall not otherwise be liable to Tenant for any delay in restoring the Premises or any inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant or injury to Tenant's business resulting in any way from the damage or the repairs, Tenant's sole remedy being the right to an abatement of Rent.

                15. CONDEMNATION. If the whole or any substantial part of the Premises shall be condemned by eminent domain or acquired by private purchase in lieu of condemnation, this Lease shall terminate on the date on which possession of the Premises is delivered to the condemning authority and Rent shall be apportioned and paid to that date. If no portion of the Premises is taken but a substantial portion of the Project is taken, at Landlord's option, this Lease shall terminate on the date on which possession of such portion of the Project is delivered to the condemning authority and Rent shall be apportioned and paid to that date. Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord, and assigns to Landlord any claims it may have otherwise had, for the value of any unexpired portion of the Lease Term, or any Alterations. Tenant shall not be entitled to any part of the condemnation award or private purchase price. If this Lease is not terminated as provided above, Rent shall abate in proportion to the portion of the Premises condemned.

                16. REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE.

                         16.1 General. Landlord shall repair and maintain in good order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, the Common Areas, mechanical and equipment rooms, the roof of the Building, the exterior walls of the Building, the exterior windows of the Building, the structural portions of the Building, the elevators, and the electrical, plumbing, mechanical, fire protection, life safety, and air conditioning, heating, and ventilation (""HVAC"") systems servicing the Building. However, unless the Waiver of Subrogation section applies, Tenant shall pay the cost of any such repairs or maintenance resulting from acts or omissions of the Tenant Parties. Tenant waives the provisions of any law, or any right Tenant may have under common law, permitting Tenant to make repairs at Landlord's expense or to withhold Rent or terminate this Lease based on any alleged failure of Landlord to make repairs. Except to the extent Landlord is obligated to repair and maintain the Premises as provided above, Tenant shall, at its sole cost, repair, replace, and maintain the Premises (including the walls, ceilings, and floors in the Premises, and any specialized or supplemental electrical, lighting, plumbing, mechanical, fire protection, life safety and HVAC systems exclusively for Tenant's use) in a clean, attractive, first-class condition. All replacements shall be of equal quality and class to the original items replaced. Tenant shall not commit or allow to be committed any waste on any portion of the Premises.

                         16.2 Cosmetic Refurbishment. After the fifth anniversary of the Commencement Date, and thereafter upon the fifth anniversary of the completion of any Alterations under this section, Tenant shall refurbish the Premises, which as a result of wear, normal depreciation, or any other cause are of a quality which in Landlord's reasonable judgment is not consistent with the level of quality of, or generally prevailing within, the Project. Any such worn or depreciated improvements will be replaced with materials and workmanship of a quality at least equal to the original installation for which replacement is made and subject to the Alterations article. Landlord shall contribute up to 85% of such costs, not to exceed $600,000($1,230.55/sf), which payment shall be made within 30 days after substantial completion of the Alterations, and delivery to Landlord of final releases of lien from Tenant’s general contractor and all lienors giving notice as defined in the Florida Construction Lien Law and a final contractor’s affidavit from the general contractor in accordance with the Florida Construction Lien Law, and all other receipts and supporting information concerning payment for the work that Landlord may reasonably request.",Repair and Maintenance,Common Areas

"MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (this “Agreement”) is entered into and made effective as of April 4, 2018 between Docugami Inc., a Delaware corporation, whose address is 150 Lake Street South, Suite 221, Kirkland, Washington 98033, and Caleb Divine, an individual, whose address is 1201 Rt 300, Newburgh NY 12550.

The above named parties desire to engage in discussions regarding a potential agreement or other transaction between the parties (the “Purpose”). In connection with such discussions, it may be necessary for the parties to disclose to each other certain confidential information or materials to enable them to evaluate whether to enter into such agreement or transaction.

In consideration of the foregoing, the parties agree as follows:

1.        Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means any information or materials disclosed by one party to the other party that: (i) if disclosed in writing or in the form of tangible materials, is marked “confidential” or “proprietary” at the time of such disclosure; (ii) if disclosed orally or by visual presentation, is identified as “confidential” or “proprietary” at the time of such disclosure, and is summarized in a writing sent by the disclosing party to the receiving party within thirty (30) days after any such disclosure; or (iii) due to its nature or the circumstances of its disclosure, a person exercising reasonable business judgment would understand to be confidential or proprietary.



2.        Obligations and Restrictions. Each party agrees: (i) to maintain the other party's Confidential Information in strict confidence; (ii) not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third party; and (iii) not to use such Confidential Information for any purpose except for the Purpose. Each party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to its employees and consultants who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for the Purpose, but solely to the extent necessary to pursue the Purpose and for no other purpose; provided, that each such employee and consultant first executes a written agreement (or is otherwise already bound by a written agreement) that contains use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective of the other party’s Confidential Information as those set forth in this Agreement.



3.        Exceptions. The obligations and restrictions in Section 2 will not apply to any information or materials that:



(i)        were, at the date of disclosure, or have subsequently become, generally known or available to the public through no act or failure to act by the receiving party;



(ii)        were rightfully known by the receiving party prior to receiving such information or materials from the disclosing party;



(iii)        are rightfully acquired by the receiving party from a third party who has the right to disclose such information or materials without breach of any confidentiality obligation to the disclosing party;





4.        Compelled Disclosure. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to restrict a party from disclosing the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by any order, subpoena, law, statute or regulation; provided, that the party required to make such a disclosure uses reasonable efforts to give the other party reasonable advance notice of such required disclosure in order to enable the other party to prevent or limit such disclosure.



5.        Return of Confidential Information. Upon the completion or abandonment of the Purpose, and in any event upon the disclosing party’s request, the receiving party will promptly return to the disclosing party all tangible items and embodiments containing or consisting of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information and all copies thereof (including electronic copies), and any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations, memoranda or other documents (regardless of the form thereof) prepared by or on behalf of the receiving party that contain or are based upon the disclosing party’s Confidential Information.



6.        No Obligations. Each party retains the right to determine whether to disclose any Confidential Information to the other party.



7.        No Warranty. ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED BY THE DISCLOSING PARTY “AS IS”.



8.        Term. This Agreement will remain in effect for a period of seven (7) years from the date of last disclosure of Confidential Information by either party, at which time it will terminate.



9.        Equitable Relief. Each party acknowledges that the unauthorized use or disclosure of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information may cause the disclosing party to incur irreparable harm and significant damages, the degree of which may be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, each party agrees that the disclosing party will have the right to seek immediate equitable relief to enjoin any unauthorized use or disclosure of its Confidential Information, in addition to any other rights and remedies that it may have at law or otherwise.



10.        Non-compete. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, Caleb Divine may not market software products or do business that directly or indirectly competes with Docugami software products.



11.        Miscellaneous. This Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, excluding its body of law controlling conflict of laws. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings and communications, oral or written, between the parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision of this Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Neither party may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without the other party’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment without such consent will be void. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

"72. Renewal Option 



 Tenant shall have the right, to be exercised as hereinafter provided, to extend the term of this lease for one (1) period of five (5) years ( “Renewal Term”) upon the following terms and conditions: 



 (a)   that at the time of the exercise of each such right and at the commencement of the Renewal Term, Tenant shall not be in default beyond the applicable notice and cure period provided in this lease; 







 (b)   that Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing that Tenant intends to exercise such option no later than the date that is twelve (12) months prior to the Expiration Date; and 







(c)   that the Renewal Term shall be upon the same terms, covenants and conditions as in this lease provided, except that (i) there shall be no further option to extend this lease beyond the Renewal Term referred to above; (ii) the Demised Premises shall be delivered in its then “as is” condition; and (iii) the Rent to be paid by Tenant during the Renewal Term shall be as follows: The Rent for the first year of the subject Renewal Term shall be equal to the greater of (A) ninety-five (95%) percent of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent (as hereinafter defined), but in no event higher than one hundred ten (110%) percent of the Rent payable during the Lease Year immediately preceding the first day of the Renewal Term, and (B) one hundred three (103%) percent of the Rent payable during the Lease Year immediately preceding the first day of the Renewal Term. Thereafter, the Rent for each year of the Renewal Term shall be increased by three (3%) percent of the Rent payable for the prior year of the Renewal Term. As used herein, the term “Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent” shall mean the rate then being received by landlords when entering into new leases for comparable size space in comparable buildings for a comparable term in the vicinity of the Building. 





 If Tenant timely exercises this Renewal Option, Landlord shall notify Tenant (the “Rent Notice”) at least one hundred twenty (120) days before the Expiration Date of Landlord’s determination of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent and Landlord’s calculation of the Rent payable during the first year of the Renewal Term and during each successive year of the Renewal Term in accordance with the formula set forth above (“Landlord’s Determination”). Tenant shall notify Landlord (“Tenant’s Notice”), within thirty (30) days after Tenant’s receipt of the Rent Notice, whether Tenant accepts or disputes Landlord’s Determination, and if Tenant disputes Landlord’s Determination, Tenant’s Notice shall set forth Tenant’s determination of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent and Tenant’s calculation of the Rent payable during the first year of the Renewal Term and during each successive year of the Renewal Term in accordance with the formula set forth above (“Tenant’s Determination”). If Tenant fails to give Tenant’s Notice within such thirty (30) day period, Tenant shall be deemed to have accepted Landlord’s Determination. 



 If Tenant timely disputes Landlord’s Determination and Landlord and Tenant fail to agree as to the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent (and, accordingly, the Rent payable by Tenant during the subject Renewal Term) within thirty (30) days after the giving of Tenant’s Notice, then the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent shall be determined as follows: A licensed real estate appraiser (the “Appraiser”) shall be selected and paid for jointly by Landlord and Tenant. If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree upon the Appraiser, then the same shall be designated by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The Appraiser selected by the parties or designated by the AAA shall have at least ten (10) years’ experience in the appraisal of retail space in Manhattan, NY. Landlord and Tenant shall each submit to the Appraiser and to the other its determination of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent. The parties shall instruct the Appraiser to (A) conduct the hearings and investigations that he or she deems appropriate, and 

 (B)  choose either Landlord's determination or Tenant's determination submitted to the Appraiser as the better estimate of Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent, being the determination which is closer to the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent determined by the Appraiser using the definition set forth in this Article 72, within thirty (30) days after the date that the Appraiser is designated. The Appraiser's aforesaid choice shall be conclusive and binding upon Landlord and Tenant. Each party shall pay its own counsel fees and expenses, if any, in connection with the procedure described herein, and fifty (50%) percent of any AAA fees and fees of the Appraiser. Either Landlord or Tenant shall have the right to submit to the Appraiser any material in support of its determination of Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent within ten (10) business days of the date of the selection of the Appraiser. After a determination has been made of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent, the parties shall execute and deliver a lease amendment memorializing the extension of the Term as described in this Article 72 and setting forth the Rent payable by Tenant during the Renewal Term, but the failure to so execute and deliver any such instrument shall not affect the determination of Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent (and, accordingly, the Rent payable during the Renewal Term). 





 (iii) If Tenant timely disputes Landlord’s Determination and if the final determination of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent shall not be made on or before the first day of the subject Renewal Term then, pending such final determination, Tenant shall pay, as Rent for the subject Renewal Term, an amount equal to Landlord’s Determination. If, based upon the final determination of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent, the Rent payments made by Tenant for such portion of the subject Renewal Term were (i) less than they should have been, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord the amount of such deficiency within ten (10) business days after demand therefor, or (ii) greater than they should have been, then Landlord shall credit the amount of such excess against installments of Rent next coming due. 



         Time shall be of the essence with respect to all obligations under this Article 72.

 Upon execution of this Lease, Tenant has deposited with Landlord the sum of $78,000.00 in good funds as security for the full and faithful performance and observance by Tenant of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease (the “Security”).

Such use, application, or retention by the Landlord shall be without prejudice to Landlord’s rights to seek any and all additional rent and/or damages that may have accrued. If Tenant shall fully and faithfully observe and perform all of the terms, covenants, and conditions of this Lease, the Security, shall be returned to Tenant after the end of the term of this Lease or at permissible early termination as provided herein and the delivery of possession of the demised Premises to Landlord. 



 Landlord shall not be obligated to place the Security in an interest bearing account. The annual interest or amounts earned and received on such Security shall be retained by the Landlord and shall be deemed as additional rent. If the entire Security, or any portion thereof, be applied by Landlord, then Tenant will on Landlord's written demand remit to Landlord as Additional Rent hereunder within ten

 In the event of a sale, transfer or leasing of the Premises by Landlord, Landlord shall have the right to transfer the Security to the vendee, transferee or lessee, whereupon Landlord shall be deemed released by Tenant from all liability for the return of said Security, except that Landlord shall remain responsible for the Security Deposit paid hereunder, until such time as [a] a successor landlord or party in interest assumes in writing the obligations therefore and [2] Landlord provides notice of assignment to Tenant. In such event, Tenant agrees to look solely to such new Landlord for the return of said Security. This Article shall apply to every transfer or assignment of the Security to a new Landlord. Tenant shall not assign or encumber the Security, and Landlord shall not be bound by any such assignment and encumbrance.

On the first day of the month following each anniversary of the Rent Commencement Date of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord funds sufficient so that the un-applied Security held by Landlord shall at all times equal three times the monthly fixed rent then reserved under Article 40 of this Lease. 



 If Landlord applies or retains all or any portion of the Security, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, within five (5) days of Landlord’s demand, as additional rent the amount so applied or retained, so that the un-applied Security shall be at all times no less than an amount equal to three times the monthly fixed rent then reserved under Article 40 of this Lease.

 (ii) the amount of $78,000.00 representing the security deposit. 



 Tenant also covenants to pay, from time to time as provided in this Lease, as additional rent: all other amounts and obligations which Tenant assumes or agrees to pay under this Lease; a “Late Charge” equal to five percent (5%) of the overdue payment of any item of fixed or additional rent not paid within ten (10) days after the date when due (or, if a demand therefor is required by the provisions of this Lease, within ten (10) days after the date of such demand), which Late Charge shall be payable as additional rent. In the event of any failure on the part of Tenant to pay any additional rent, Landlord shall have all the rights, powers and remedies provided for in this Lease, at law, in equity or otherwise, in the case of nonpayment of fixed rent. Nothing herein shall be construed to extend the due dates of Tenant's payments under this Lease, or to waive any rights or remedies of Landlord in the event of Tenant's late payment. Tenant's obligations to pay fixed rent and additional rent shall survive the expiration of the Lease term or earlier termination of this Lease. 





 The provisions of this Article are in addition to all other rights or remedies available to Landlord for nonpayment of fixed rent or additional rent under this Lease and at law and in equity. Tenant further agrees that the Late Charge imposed is fair and reasonable, complies with all laws, regulations and statutes, and constitutes an agreement between Landlord and Tenant as to the estimated compensation for costs and administrative expenses incurred by Landlord due to the late payment of rent to Landlord by Tenant. Tenant further agrees that the Late Charge assessed pursuant to this Lease is not interest and the Late Charge assessed does not constitute a lender or borrower/creditor relationship between Landlord and Tenant or a penalty of any kind. It is understood that said late charge is directly related to Landlord’s actual costs and expenses incurred as a result of late payment. 



 All fixed rent and additional rent (collectively hereinafter referred to as ""rent"") shall be paid in such coin or currency (or, subject to collection, by good check payable in such coin or currency) of the United States of America as at the time shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, at the office of Landlord as set forth above, or at such place and to such person as Landlord from time to time may designate. 



 All rent shall be paid to Landlord without notice, demand, counterclaim, setoff, deduction or defense, and nothing shall suspend, defer, diminish, abate, or reduce any rent, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Lease or by law. 



 Tenant shall make all rental payments in full. Payment or receipt of a rental payment of less than the amount stated in this Lease shall be deemed to be nothing more than partial payment on account. Under no circumstances shall Landlord’s acceptance of a partial payment constitute accord and satisfaction. Nor will Landlord’s acceptance of a partial payment forfeit Landlord’s right to collect the balance due on the account, together with applicable late charges and interest despite any endorsement, stipulation, or other statement on any check. 



 Landlord may accept any partial payment check with any conditional endorsement without prejudice to its right to recover the balance remaining due, or to pursue any other remedy available under this Lease, law or equity. 



 Landlord in its sole discretion may allocate without prejudice any payment in whole or in part to any due item of fixed rent, additional rent and/or any other charges or to any combination thereof. 



 If Landlord commences any action or proceeding against Tenant, or if Landlord is required to defend any action or proceeding commenced by Tenant, in connection with this lease or the Premises, and Landlord shall be the prevailing party in any such action for proceeding, Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant in such action or proceeding, or a subsequently commenced action or proceeding, Landlord's reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements and all applicable interest thereon at the statutory rate incurred in connection with such action or proceeding and any appeals, including but not limited to fees on fees incurred to collect said monies. 



 Landlord’s failure during the Lease term to prepare and deliver any of the statements, notices, or bills for rent and/or additional rent or Landlord’s failure to make a demand, shall not in any way cause Landlord to forfeit or surrender its rights to collect any of the items of rent and/or additional rent that may have become due during the term of this Lease.

              Patients will be required to attend the CRU on at least 8 occasions (no more than 10 occasions if dose-finding and/or one MMTT rescheduled) as noted in the Study Schedule (see Section 2):

                   Informed consent

                   Screening visit

                   Lead-in and insulin transition period (see Section 9.2.1)

                   4 inpatient CRU study visits (including dose finding assessment [see Section 9.2.2])

                   A follow-up visit

              Eligible patients who have satisfied the entry criteria and completed all screening procedures will return to the CRU at least 2 weeks prior to Period 1 Day -2 to begin a lead-in and insulin transition period. When patients visit the CRU to begin the lead-in period, patients will receive instruction on general diabetes education including measurement of self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) and receive instruction on the insulin transition (see Section 9.2.1). During the insulin transition period, patients will transition from their current basal insulin therapy to site- provided insulin glargine and Humalog CCI (see Section 9.2.1). Following insulin transition, patients will return to the CRU for the dose-finding assessment (see Section 9.2.2) on either the evening of Day -2, Period 1 or early morning of Day -1, Period 1. The dose-finding assessment will use Humalog administered immediately before a standardized liquid test meal (MMTT) to inform the dose of LY900014 and Humalog to be used during subsequent study MMTT assessments. Upon completion of the dose-finding assessment, patients will be randomised to 1 of 4 treatment sequences. Prior to the MMTT in each study period, patients will undergo a run-in period (see Section 9.2.3.1) to achieve a predetermined glucose target of 135 ±15 mg/dL (7.5 ±0.8 mmol/L). Once the glucose target has been attained, patients will proceed with the MMTT in which a single individualized SC dose of LY900014 or Humalog will be administered either immediately before the test meal or 20 minutes following the start of the test meal (see Section 9.2.3.2).

              Doses of LY900014 and Humalog during the 4 study periods will be separated by a minimum washout of approximately 21 hours. The maximum duration allowed for all 4 periods is approximately 6 weeks. Patients will continue using site-provided Humalog and insulin glargine during the washout periods between MMTTs (see Section 7.7 for use of concomitant medication and basal insulin). During the washout periods, patients will be instructed to perform regular blood glucose monitoring (see Section 9.5.7).

              Following completion of all study procedures in each Period, patients may be offered a meal and discharged from the CRU at the discretion of the principal investigator.

              Study governance considerations are described in detail in Appendix 3.

              5.2. Number of Participants

              Up to 36 patients may be enrolled so that approximately 30 patients complete the study. For purposes of this study, a patient completes the study when all scheduled procedures shown in the Schedule of Activities have been finished. Patients who drop out may be replaced, and the replacement patient will adopt all 4 assigned crossover treatments of the original patient’s randomization schedule.

              5.3. End of Study Definition

              End of the study is the date of the last visit or last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities (Section 2) for the last patient.

              5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design

              The study is a 4-period crossover design to reduce the variability of insulin PK and GD, as each patient will act as his/her own control. The total number of patients needed with a crossover design is less than the number needed with a parallel group design. A maximum duration of approximately 6 weeks is allowed for patients to complete all 4 assigned periods to minimize the risk of insulin resistance/changes in mean glycemic control during the study.

              Randomization and blinding are used to avoid bias introduced through an association between allocation order of investigational medicinal product (IMP) and patient characteristics. The Lilly clinical pharmacologist (CP)/Lilly study team will be unblinded.

              In each study period patients will undergo a run-in period before the MMTT using a variable insulin and glucose IV infusion. This run-in period will allow for improved comparability of the postprandial glucose response to a mixed meal after treatment with LY900014 and Humalog administered either immediately before the start of the meal, or 20 minutes following the start of the test meal. This run-in aims to achieve similar preprandial glucose levels for all patients before the start of the test meal and thereby reduces the variability of the postprandial glucose response. Insulin glulisine has been chosen for the IV optimization of blood glucose during the run-in because insulin glulisine does not cross-react with the insulin lispro–specific assay used for the PK analysis.

              Under this design, if two periods occur on consecutive days, the interval between the last bolus on the first day and the first bolus on the second day is much longer compared to the length of time that the treatment (LY900014 or Humalog) lasts in the bloodstream; therefore, no carryover effect is assumed. This enables PK and GD data from the breakfast meal tests of each period to be analyzed independently and separately.

              A minimum of approximately 21 hours washout between the test meals allows for a complete washout of study drug administered with the MMTT and glucose response and prevents carry- over effects.

              5.5. Justification for Dose

              The bolus dose of insulin lispro (LY900014 or Humalog) will be individualized per patient to cover the carbohydrate content in this standardized liquid test meal. This dose of insulin is reflective of a clinically relevant, individualized insulin dosing, similar to how patients would determine the insulin dose for the carbohydrate content in a meal. For each patient, the individualized prandial insulin lispro dose in LY900014 and Humalog for each test meal must be kept identical throughout the crossover periods.

                                              6. Study Population

              Eligibility of patients for study enrollment will be based on the results of screening medical history, physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiogram (ECG).

              The nature of any conditions present at the time of the physical examination and any preexisting conditions will be documented.

              Screening may occur over a 14 day period prior to the lead-in site visit. Patients who are not entered within this time period, may be subjected to an additional medical assessment and/or clinical measurements to confirm their eligibility.

              Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, are not permitted.

              6.1. Inclusion Criteria

              Patients are eligible for inclusion in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria at screening and/or enrollment:

                     [1] are male or female patients with T1DM for at least 1 year. A diagnosis of T1DM is based on medical history with a fasting C-peptide <0.30 nmol/L.

                               a. Male patients:

                                      i. No male contraception required except in compliance with specific local government requirements

                               b. Female patients:

                                      i. Women of child-bearing potential who are abstinent (if this is complete abstinence, as their preferred and usual lifestyle) or in a same sex relationship (as part of their preferred and usual lifestyle) must agree to either remain abstinent or stay in a same sex relationship without sexual relationships with males.

                                      ii. Otherwise, women of child-bearing potential participating must agree to use one highly effective method of contraception until discharge from final treatment period.

                                             1. Women of child bearing potential must test negative for pregnancy prior to initiation of treatment as indicated by a negative serum pregnancy test at the screening visit followed by a negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to exposure in Period 1.

                                             2. A highly effective method of contraception includes a combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) or progestogen-only hormonal contraception administered orally, intravaginally, or transdermally and is associated with inhibition of ovulation. Alternatively, patients may use either an intrauterine device, intrauterine hormone-releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion, or the partner should have been vasectomised.

                                     iii. Women not of childbearing potential may participate and include those who are:

                                             1. infertile due to surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy), congenital anomaly such as mullerian agenesis; or

                                             2. post-menopausal – defined as a woman being amenorrheic for more than 1 year without an alternative medical cause and a serum follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) level compatible with postmenopausal status. A FSH level in the post- menopausal range may be used to confirm a post- menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal re",Inclusion Criteria,Insulin Transition Period

"47. Alterations and Additions 



 Except as provided herein, Tenant shall not be entitled to make any structural alterations of or additions to the Premises or any alterations, additions or changes whatsoever to the exterior of the Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord in each instance, which consent Landlord may withhold or condition unreasonably or for any reason or for no reason; and, except as provided herein , and excepting purely cosmetic changes or additions up to an amount of $20,000, Tenant shall not be entitled to make any non-structural alterations of or additions to the Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord in each instance, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. (Any alterations to the Premises made by Tenant shall hereinafter be referred to as ""Tenant's Alterations""). 



 In granting its consent to any Tenant's Alterations as defined in this Article, Landlord may impose such reasonable conditions (including completion, payment, restoration and if Tenant's Alterations are reasonably expected to cost in excess of $25,000, a requirement that Tenant either post a bond to insure the completion of and payment for Tenant's Alterations or furnish Landlord with other financial security reasonably satisfactory to Landlord to assure Landlord that Tenant’s Alterations will be completed lien free) as Landlord may reasonably require. In no event shall Landlord be required to consent to any Tenant's Alterations which would physically affect any part of the Building outside of the Premises or would adversely affect the proper functioning of the mechanical, electrical, sanitary or other service systems of the Building. At the time Tenant requests Landlord's written consent to Tenant’s Alterations, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord detailed plans and specifications therefor. Tenant shall pay to Landlord any reasonable fees or expenses in connection with Tenant's Alterations incurred by Landlord in connection with Landlord's submitting such plans and specifications, if it so chooses, to an architect or engineer selected by Landlord for review or examination. Tenant shall pay to Landlord the minimum sum of $750.00 to reimburse Landlord for the administrative costs of initial review and processing of proposed Tenant’s Alterations plans and specifications, in each instance; and if, in connection therewith, Landlord incurs expenses in excess of said $750.00 amount, then Tenant shall pay Landlord the amount of such excess fees as additional rent within ten (10) days of Landlord’s submission to Tenant of bills for same. Landlord's approval of any plans or specifications does not relieve Tenant from the responsibility for the legal sufficiency and technical competency thereof. Before commencement of any Tenant’s Alterations, (a) Tenant shall obtain the necessary consents, authorizations and licenses from all federal, state and/or municipal authorities having jurisdiction over such work, and (b) Tenant shall provide Landlord with a bond insuring Landlord against non-payment for any work to be performed by Tenant or furnish Landlord with other financial security reasonably satisfactory to Landlord to assure Landlord that Tenant’s Alterations will be completed lien free. Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely in connection with Tenant’s Initial Alterations (defined below), Tenant shall not be required to pay Landlord or its designee for Landlord’s review of Tenant’s Initial Alterations plans or Landlord’s supervision, if any, or any other Landlord out-of-pocket cost of Tenant’s Initial Alterations or post a bond to insure the completion of and payment for Tenant's Alterations. “Initial Alterations” shall refer to the alterations made to the Premises by Tenant as part of, and as approved by Landlord as, Tenant’s initial build-out of the Premises prior to commencement of operations by Tenant. Landlord consents to Tenant’s Initial Alterations described on annexed Exhibit D. Tenant agrees to indemnify and save Landlord harmless from and against any and all bills for labor performed and equipment, fixtures and materials furnished to Tenant and applicable sales taxes thereon as required by New York law and from and against any and all liens, bills or claims therefor or against the Premises or the Building and from and against all losses, damages, costs, expenses, suits, and claims whatsoever in connection with Tenant’s Alterations. 



 Tenant, at its expense, shall cause any Tenant’s Alterations consented to by Landlord to be performed in compliance with all applicable requirements of insurance bodies having jurisdiction and in such manner as not to interfere with, delay or impose any additional expense upon the Landlord in the maintenance or operation of the Building. 



 If the performance of Tenant’s Alterations shall interfere with the comfort and/or convenience of other tenants in the Building or shall cause damage to or otherwise interfere with the 





 occupancy of adjacent Buildings, Tenant shall upon Landlord's demand remedy or remove the condition or conditions complained of. Tenant further covenants and agrees to save Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, costs, expenses including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, suits and demands whatsoever made or asserted against Landlord by reason of the foregoing. 



 Tenant’s Alterations may be performed only from Monday through Friday and only during the hours from 9:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. and at no other times. 



 Promptly after the completion of any Tenant’s Alterations, Tenant shall furnish to Landlord a complete set of ""as-built"" plans and specifications. 



 Tenant agrees that any exercise of its rights pursuant to this Lease shall not be done in a manner that would: (a) create any work stoppage, picketing, labor disruption, or dispute; (b) materially interfere with the business of Landlord or any tenant or occupant of the Building. In the event of the occurrence of any condition described above arising from Tenant's exercise of any of its rights pursuant to this Lease, Tenant shall, immediately upon notice from Landlord, cease the manner of exercise of such right giving rise to such condition. In the event that Tenant fails to cease the manner of exercise of its rights as aforesaid, Landlord, in addition to any rights available to it under this lease and pursuant to law, shall have the right to injunction without further notice. 



 Promptly following the completion of all of Tenant’s Alterations, and as soon as reasonably feasible, Tenant shall obtain and furnish to Landlord all appropriate certifications, including but not limited to a New York City Department of Buildings Letter of Completion, from all authorities having jurisdiction to the effect that all Tenant’s Alterations have been performed and completed in accordance with Tenant's Plans and with all Requirements, and Tenant shall close out all permits and obtain all final sign-offs. In the event that Tenant fails to comply with the terms of this paragraph within 90 days after the completion of Tenant’s Alterations, then in that event, Landlord may, but is not required to, take such steps as are commercially reasonable to close out all permits, obtain final sign-offs and a Letter of Completion and otherwise act to cause Tenant’s obligations under this paragraph to be satisfied and thereupon Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all costs and fees incurred by Landlord in connection therewith as additional rent within 15 days of demand by Landlord for payment. 



 Subject to all of the foregoing provisions hereof, including without limitation, the compliance with Requirements, Tenant shall only be permitted to commence and carry on Tenant’s Alterations provided: (i) Tenant delivers to Landlord not less than three (3) days prior to the commencement of Tenant's Alterations, an endorsement of its liability insurance policy referred to herein, covering and holding Landlord harmless against any and all claims or liability arising out of Tenant’s Alterations; (ii) Tenant delivers to Landlord, not less than five days prior to the commencement of Tenant's Alterations, sufficient proof that Tenant's contractors maintain workers compensation insurance to cover all persons engaged in Tenant's Alterations; and (iii) Landlord is reasonably satisfied that Tenant's contractors will perform Tenant's Alterations in a first-class workman-like manner, using all first-class materials. 



 If Tenant is unable to obtain a permit for its Initial Alterations and/or a required permit or license to operate Tenant’s business due to any act or omission of Landlord's or due to a condition or violation arising prior to delivery of possession of the Demised Premises to Tenant (hereinafter collectively called ""Pre-existing Conditions""), Landlord shall use best efforts to promptly correct such condition, and the time which expires until such condition is corrected and Tenant is notified of same shall be added on so that the Rent Commencement Date shall be deferred because of such Pre-existing Conditions.",Tenant Alterations Consent,Alterations and Additions

                             Section 1.1 Subject to the terms and provisions hereof, Shipper agrees to tender to Carrier an indeterminable number of Shipments (hereinafter defined) during the term of this Agreement, but not less than three

                   (3) per year, and Carrier agrees to provide Suitable Equipment (hereinafter defined) to transport said Shipments, provided the booking procedures set forth in Section 1.4 herein are followed and Carrier agrees to transport such

                                       shipments in accordance with the terms and conditions stated herein.

                            Section 1.2 A Shipment shall consist of a full trailer load of Commodities. Suitable Equipment means (i) a refrigerated trailer that is at least 55 feet long and 102 inches wide, that will haul a minimum of 50000 pounds gross weight of product, with each said trailer being clean, insect and rodent free, odor free, water tight and uncontaminated by prior use, not ever having been used for transportation or storage of toxic chemicals of any kind, including, without limitation, insecticides, rodenticides, and/or hazardous materials, substances or chemicals, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by waiver of specified materials executed by Shipper’s Sr. Vice President of Quality Control and Vice President of Risk Management, at Shipper’s sole discretion, prior to Shipment; and (ii) a tractor power unit with sufficient power for towing the trailer, in good operating condition and repair, and with a driver experienced in handling the transportation of Commodities with such a rig and trailer and with a good driving

                                                                     record.

                 Section 1.3 Carrier shall furnish to Shipper a copy of the United States Department of Transportation General Motor Carrier Safety Administration Form MCS-150, Form MCS-90, and Form BMC-91X filed by Carrier as well

                                        as subsequent updates for the duration of the business relationship.

                          Section 1.4 When Shipper desires Carrier to transport a Shipment, Shipper will notify Carrier by e- mail, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), verbally and/or by facsimile, specifying the load, the destination, and the date by which the load must reach the destination. Carrier will either accept or reject the opportunity to transport the Shipment by return e-mail, EDI, and/or facsimile to the Shipper in Section 13.4. If Carrier accepts, Carrier will be bound by the terms of this Agreement with respect to each such Shipment. If Carrier rejects, the rejected load will be

                    considered as an allocated load to the Carrier in accordance with Shipper obligations to award Carrier primary

                          Section 1.5 Time is of the essence in Carrier’s performance of its obligations hereunder, and Carrier agrees to provide timely communication relative to load tenders and to transport all Shipments with prompt and reasonable dispatch in accordance with scheduled delivery dates set by Shipper and its customers, as communicated to Carrier as set forth in Section 1.4 herein, subject, however, to compliance by Carrier with applicable laws and

                                              regulations and to conditions beyond Carrier’s control.

                 Section 2.1 Carrier shall be compensated for each Shipment in accordance with the rates set forth on IBIDTransport.com, a web-based rate management system, or based on the delivery destination of the cargo, the total number of tons of cargo hauled by Carrier and the agreed upon rate as contained in the applicable purchase order. The fees paid to Carrier shall be no more favorable than the fees paid by Shipper to any other third party carrier. User name and password will be issued by Ilens Logistics Group at the request of Sandy’s Express. Carrier agrees that “P. C. Miler v.14” shortest miles option shall be utilized as the basis for computing the mileage from the point of origination of a shipment to the point of destination of a Shipment. Any deviation from this aforementioned method must be approved in advance in writing by Shipper.

                   Section 2.2 Carrier represents and warrants that, during the term of this Agreement, the rates agreed upon hereunder as may be modified in accordance with the terms hereof from time to time, together with all charges, surcharges, rebates, discounts, incentives and allowances agreed upon by the parties (collectively, “Pricing Terms”), offered to Sandy’s Express under this Agreement, are and will remain as favorable as, or better than the Pricing Terms offered by Carrier to any other shipper shipping similar products in like quantities. In the event that Carrier at any time agrees, in writing or otherwise, to Pricing Terms with another shipper that are in any way more favorable than the Pricing Terms agreed to with Sandy’s Express, Carrier shall promptly notify Sandy’s Express in writing and offer such terms to Sandy’s Express. In the event Sandy’s Express accepts such modified terms, the parties shall promptly prepare and execute an amendment to this Agreement reflecting such revised terms. Carrier (or its applicable subsidiary) shall annually on the anniversary of this Agreement, certify to Sandy’s Express that Carrier

                                                    remains in compliance with this provision.

                 Section 2.3 At the time the Shipment is fully delivered, an invoice covering that Shipment will be generated by Carrier and delivered to Shipper, in accordance with the rates Carrier places in IBID, or based on the delivery destination of the cargo, the total number of tons of cargo hauled by Carrier and the agreed upon rate as contained in the applicable purchase order. The invoice will be due and payable thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the invoice, provided that on or before said date Shipper has received from Carrier (i) duly executed receipt(s) from whom delivery was made concerning the applicable invoice, and (ii) such other supporting materials as Shipper may reasonably require.

                 Section 2.4 Carrier shall maintain complete and accurate records of each Shipment and all transactions under

                    this Agreement, including all supporting documentation and proof of delivery, and in a manner consistent with generally acceptable accounting procedures. Within two (2) days notice by Shipper, Carrier shall provide Shipper and/or its representatives with access to and the right to examine all records involving any transaction related to the Agreement. Such right shall be for the period covered by this Agreement and until the expiration of five (5) years

                         Section 3.1 Within thirty (30) days after Shipper’s receipt of Carrier’s delivery receipt, Shipper shall pay Carrier the rates and charges applicable to the shipment of cargo. In exchange for Shipper’s guarantee of prompt payment, (i) agrees not to contact Shipper’s customers, consignors, consignees or any party other than Shipper

                      concerning payment for transportation services; and, (ii) agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Shipper, its customers, consignors, and consignees harmless from any claim or demand made by any subcontractor of Carrier or other party for payment for transportation services related to a shipment of cargo tendered under this Agreement.

                             Section 3.2 Any claim for overpayment or underpayment for transportation services provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be presented by the party asserting the claim to the other party within sixty (60) days of discovery of the claim, but in no event will any such claim(s) be asserted more than one hundred eighty

41. Escalations 



 Tenant shall pay, during the term of this Lease, the additional rent provided for in this Article 41. As used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below: 



 “Taxes” shall mean the total of all real estate taxes and assessments and special assessments imposed, payable and paid upon the Premises described as the land and building in which the Premises are located including, without limitation, vault taxes, rents or charges, imposed by any Governmental Authority, of which the demised Premises forms a part. If at any time during the term of this Lease the methods of taxation prevailing at the commencement of the term hereof shall be altered so that in lieu of or as a substitute for the whole or any part of the taxes, assessments, levies, impositions of charges now levied, assessed or imposed on the real estate and the improvements thereon, there shall be levied, assessed or imposed (i) a tax, assessment, levy imposition or charge wholly or partially as capital levy or otherwise on the rents received therefrom, or (ii) a tax assessment levy upon the Building, Land Improvements or the Premises and imposed upon Landlord, or (iii) a license fee measured by the rents payable, or the part thereof so measured or based shall be deemed to be included within the term ""Taxes"" for the purposes hereof. 



 ""Escalation Year"" shall mean each twelve month period or portion thereof, ending on June 30, occurring within the term of this Lease. 



 ""Base Year"" shall mean the twelve month period ending on June 30, 2022. 



 ""Base Year Taxes"" shall mean the Taxes for the Base Year. 



 The ""building"" shall mean the land and the building of which the demised Premises forms a part. ""Tenant's Share"" shall mean 35%. 

 Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as additional rent, an amount equal to Tenant's Share of the amount by which Taxes for any Escalation Year during the term of this Lease exceed the Base Year Taxes. 



 Landlord shall submit to Tenant a statement setting forth the computation of the amount of such excess Taxes and Tenant's Share of each thereof including copies of applicable tax bills. Tenant shall pay Tenant's Share of such excess amount of Taxes within ten days after the rendition of such statement which shall separately calculate Tenant’s Share, however, the payment of Tenant's Share shall not be due earlier than 10 days before the corresponding Taxes are due to the taxing authority. 



         In no event shall the annual fixed rent under this Lease be reduced by virtue of this Article 

 41.  The computations under this Article 41 are intended to constitute a formula for an agreed rental escalation and do not necessarily constitute an actual reimbursement to Landlord for costs or expenses paid by Landlord with respect to the building. 





 Upon the date of the expiration of the Lease term or earlier termination of this Lease, a proportionate share of the additional rent payable under this Article 41 for the Escalation Year during which such expiration or termination occurs shall immediately become due and payable by Tenant to Landlord. Said proportionate share shall be based on the length of time that the term of this Lease shall be within such Escalation Year. Promptly after such expiration or termination, Landlord shall compute the additional rent due from Tenant, as aforesaid, which computation shall be an estimate based upon the most recent annual statements theretofore furnished by Landlord to Tenant. Upon written request by Tenant, Landlord shall cause a final statement showing the computation of the actual additional rent due from Tenant for that Escalation Year to be prepared and furnished to Tenant, whereupon any appropriate adjustments of 





 amount owed to Landlord shall be made. The obligations of Tenant to pay additional rent as provided for herein shall survive the expiration of the Lease term or earlier termination of this Lease. If Tenant continues in possession of the Premises after the expiration of the Lease term or earlier termination of this Lease, as a month to month tenant or otherwise, the provisions of this Article 41 shall continue in full force and effect for so long as Tenant remains in possession of the Premises. 



 The additional rent provided for herein shall be collectible by Landlord in the same manner as the regular installments of fixed rent due under this Lease. Notwithstanding anything set forth elsewhere in this Article or elsewhere in this Lease, no delay or failure by Landlord in preparing or delivering any statement or demand for any additional rent, including but not limited to the statements and/or demands provided for in this Article, shall constitute a waiver of, or impair Landlord's rights to collect, such additional rent. 



 The billing statements provided by Landlord for the charges due pursuant to this Article 41 shall constitute a final determination as between Landlord and Tenant of the additional rent for the periods represented thereby, unless Tenant within thirty days after they have been furnished shall give a written notice to Landlord that Tenant disputes their accuracy or appropriateness, which written notice shall specify the particular respects in which the statement is inaccurate or inappropriate. Pending the resolution of such dispute, Tenant shall pay the additional rent to Landlord in accordance with the statements furnished by Landlord. 



 In addition to Taxes as set forth above, Tenant shall pay within ten (10) days after invoice therefor,including copies of applicable bill, an amount equal to Tenant's Share of the amount by which any charges imposed by any Business Improvement District on the Premises or any Escalation Year during the term of this Lease exceed Business Improvement District Charges in the Base Year.",Rent Escalations,Rent Escalations

"It is unlikely that the patient has edema caused by abscess or tonsillitis since she does not have any associated fever or other signs of infection and the sudden onset of her swelling also argues against this. It is not likely a foreign body since ENT did not find anything when they scoped her.

                 It is unlikely that it is caused by a mast cell mediated etiologigy that increases vascular permeability through mast cell degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators include allergic angioedema, autoimmune mast cell release and direct mast cell release caused by medications such as opiates and radiocontrast media. It is not likely this type of reaction because these etiologies are associated with urticaria and pruritis, which the patient did not have. Also the patient did not have any exposure to a new pet, food, lotion or any other allergen or medication that could cause an allergic type reaction. The patient also does not have any history of autoimmune disease or any reaction similar to this in the past

                 It is more likely that the etiology is kinin-related where angioedema results from generation of bradykinin and complement-derived mediators that increase vascular permeability since there is no urticaria or pruritis. The most likely cause is the Altace (ACEI) that the patient has been taking caused an increase in bradykinin since it decreases angiotensin 2 which degrades bradykinin. Bradykinin can then interact with vascular receptors increasing vasodilation, vascular permeability, increased cGMP and release of nitric oxide. This reaction occurs in .1-7% of patients treated with an ACEI and it typically involves the mouth, lips, tounge, larynx, pharynx and sublottic tissues. Half of these cases usually occur within a week of starting the ACEI but can occur years later. This is a class specific reaction not a drug specific and ARBs can cause the same reaction even though these drugs don’t effect the kinin metabolism. 50% of patients with angioedema due to an ARB also had an ACEI induced angioedema (Cicardi, M, Zingale, LC, Bergamschini L, Agostoni, A. Angioedema associated with agniotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use: outcome after switching to a different treatment. Arch Intern Med 2004; 164:910). Deficiency of C1 inhibitor can cause angioedema since levels of complement are reduced and cause increased bradykinin. This can be due to lack of C1 INH or adequate amounts of nonfunctional C1 INH. Other causes of angioedema include aspirin and NSAIDs since inhibition of cox and enzyme pathyway increases formation of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes.

                 Other possibilities in the differential of causes of swelling include cellulitis, autoimmune conditions including SLE, polymyositis, dermatomyositis and sjorgren’s syndrome. Hypothyroidism can cuase puffiness of face and lips, hyperthyroidism can cause an infiltrative dermopathy, superior vena cava syndrome and tumors can cause venous engorgement and swelling. It is not likely one of these etiologies since the patient is on an ACEI and the swelling is restricted only to her tongue and throat typical of ACEI angioedema.",Non-Infectious Swelling,Health Effects Explanation

"Upon execution of this Lease, Tenant has deposited with Landlord the sum of $78,000.00 in good funds as security for the full and faithful performance and observance by Tenant of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease (the “Security”). If Tenant defaults in the performance or observance of any term, covenant or condition of this Lease, including without limitation the obligation of Tenant to pay any rent or other sum required hereunder, Landlord may use, after 10 days written notice to Tenant ,apply, or retain, without any application to any court or tribunal, the whole or any part of the Security so deposited to the extent required for the payment of any rent or any other sum as to which Tenant is in default or for any sum which Landlord may expend or may be required to expend by reason of Tenant's default, including without limitation any damages or deficiency accrued before or after summary proceedings or other re-entry by Landlord. Such use, application, or retention by the Landlord shall be without prejudice to Landlord’s rights to seek any and all additional rent and/or damages that may have accrued. If Tenant shall fully and faithfully observe and perform all of the terms, covenants, and conditions of this Lease, the Security, shall be returned to Tenant after the end of the term of this Lease or at permissible early termination as provided herein and the delivery of possession of the demised Premises to Landlord. 



 Landlord shall not be obligated to place the Security in an interest bearing account. The annual interest or amounts earned and received on such Security shall be retained by the Landlord and shall be deemed as additional rent. If the entire Security, or any portion thereof, be applied by Landlord, then Tenant will on Landlord's written demand remit to Landlord as Additional Rent hereunder within ten 

 (10)  days of such demand a sufficient sum in cash to restore said Security to the amount required as set forth in this Article. 





 In the event of a sale, transfer or leasing of the Premises by Landlord, Landlord shall have the right to transfer the Security to the vendee, transferee or lessee, whereupon Landlord shall be deemed released by Tenant from all liability for the return of said Security, except that Landlord shall remain responsible for the Security Deposit paid hereunder, until such time as [a] a successor landlord or party in interest assumes in writing the obligations therefore and [2] Landlord provides notice of assignment to Tenant. In such event, Tenant agrees to look solely to such new Landlord for the return of said Security. This Article shall apply to every transfer or assignment of the Security to a new Landlord. Tenant shall not assign or encumber the Security, and Landlord shall not be bound by any such assignment and encumbrance. 



         The Security being held pursuant to this Article shall at all times be an amount equal to 





 three (3) times the monthly fixed rent then reserved under Article 40 of this Lease. On the first day of the month following each anniversary of the Rent Commencement Date of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord funds sufficient so that the un-applied Security held by Landlord shall at all times equal three times the monthly fixed rent then reserved under Article 40 of this Lease. 



 If Landlord applies or retains all or any portion of the Security, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, within five (5) days of Landlord’s demand, as additional rent the amount so applied or retained, so that the un-applied Security shall be at all times no less than an amount equal to three times the monthly fixed rent then reserved under Article 40 of this Lease. 



 Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided Tenant is not then in default of this Lease, on March 15, 2022, Landlord shall return $26,000 of the Security to the Tenant and the Security obligation shall be $52,000. In the event Tenant continues to comply with all of the terms and conditions of this Lease, and provided Tenant is not then in default of this Lease, on March 15, 2022, Landlord shall return
