             Your investment in your note involves risks.

We encourage you to read ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù on page 10 of the Offering Circular and ‚ÄúAdditional Investment Considerations Specific to Your Note‚Äù below, so that you may better understand those risks.

             If interest rates increase, in most cases, the market value of the notes will decrease and if you sell the notes prior to maturity you will receive less than the accreted value of the notes.

             Any offered notes sold by the Issuer to dealers may be resold by such dealers in negotiated transactions or otherwise at varying prices determined at the time of sale, which prices may be different from the original issue price.

"3.1 General. Tenant shall continuously use and occupy the Premises only for the Permitted Use of the Premises to the extent not prohibited by the Rules and Regulations. Tenant shall not use or permit or suffer the use of the Premises for any other business or purpose. Tenant shall conform to the Rules and Regulations. ""Rules and Regulations"" shall mean the rules and regulations for the Project promulgated by Landlord from time to time. The Rules and Regulations which apply as of the Date of this Lease are attached as EXHIBIT ""D"".

                         3.2 Restricted Uses. Tenant expressly acknowledges that Landlord has advised it of restricted, prohibited, and exclusive uses (collectively, ""Restricted Uses"") applicable to the Premises. Restricted Uses are set forth on EXHIBIT ‚ÄúF‚Äù. Tenant shall not use or permit or suffer the use of the Premises for any of the Restricted Uses. Tenant further acknowledges that the provisions in the agreements granting exclusive use rights to other tenants in the Project and the provisions of this Lease concerning the Restricted Uses are in the nature of restrictive covenants running with the land.

                         3.3 Master Covenants. ‚ÄúMaster Covenants‚Äù means that certain Declaration of Master Covenants, Easements & Restrictions and Master Deed for the Building. The parties to the Master Covenants shall be Landlord or its successors and the collective ownership of the ‚ÄúCondominium Parcel‚Äù, which Condominium Parcel constitutes floors 18 through 20 for the Building. The purpose of the Master Covenants shall be to provide for the operation, maintenance, cleaning, repairs, replacement and regulation of use of those features and elements of the Building which are utilized and enjoyed by the Condominium Parcel owners, the Landlord and the tenants of the ‚ÄúOffice Parcel‚Äù, which Office Parcel constitutes floors 1 through 17 of the Building.

                         3.4 Exclusive Use.

                                 3.4.1 Restriction. If and for as long as Tenant is not in default under this Lease beyond any applicable grace period and is not holding over beyond the expiration of the Lease Term, Landlord shall not (i) lease any space in the Building to any tenant who will engage in the primary business of coworking office space (i.e., shared or private office space available for a fee to members which includes ancillary amenities and support services) as operated by Tenant (‚ÄúExclusive Use‚Äù); or (ii) engage in the Exclusive Use at the Project. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord may construct speculative office suites. The rights granted in this section are personal to the original named Tenant in this Lease (and any Permitted Assignee) and shall be subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions: (a) no portion of the Premises is sublet to anyone (other than a Permitted Transferee) at the time Landlord would otherwise seek to lease space in violation of this restriction; and (b) this Lease has not been assigned to anyone (other than a Permitted Assignee) at the time Landlord would otherwise seek to lease space in violation of this restriction. Landlord‚Äôs obligations under this section shall automatically cease and terminate and Landlord may lease space in the Building free and clear of the restrictions imposed by this section should the Premises cease to be used primarily for the Exclusive Use or if Tenant has ceased operating the Premises for more than 90 consecutive days (except due to casualty, condemnation, or as a result of Alterations by Tenant). The rights granted in this section shall not apply to leases in existence as of the Date of this Lease (or any replacement for such leases or expansion of the premises leased under them, whether by right of first refusal, right of first offer, or other expansion right or similar right previously granted by Landlord, or otherwise, or by any of the successors, assigns, sublessees, or transferees of the tenants under such existing leases), which lease(s) currently permit the premises leased under them to be used for the Exclusive Use or for any lawful use.

                                 3.4.2 Limitation of Remedies. If Landlord violates this section by leasing space in the Building for a use that includes the Exclusive Use, and Landlord does not cure such violation within 90 days after receipt of Tenant's notice of the violation, Tenant shall have all remedies provided by law; provided that, Tenant expressly waives any right to terminate this Lease as a result of such violation. If another tenant of the Building violates a provision in its lease by engaging in the Exclusive Use, upon Tenant's request, Landlord will notify such tenant of its default and demand in writing that it cease and desist from such unauthorized use. This will be Landlord's sole liability for any such use by another tenant except that, at Tenant's request, Landlord will assign to Tenant all of Landlord's rights to enforce the defaulting tenant's lease so as to preclude the use in violation of the Exclusive Use.

                                 3.4.3 Enforceability. Landlord‚Äôs obligations under this section have been assumed as an accommodation to Tenant and as an inducement to Tenant to enter into this Lease. It is Landlord‚Äôs and Tenant‚Äôs belief that the use restriction granted to Tenant in this section is reasonable in territory, time, and person and otherwise meets applicable legal criteria so as to be enforceable under antitrust laws. However, Landlord makes no representations, express or implied, as to the enforceability of the foregoing use restriction, or whether such restrictions violate any applicable state or federal laws. If this use restriction is found to be in violation of any state or federal antitrust laws by final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, Landlord will be absolved from liability for breach of this use restriction.

                                 3.4.4 Waiver on Extension. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Lease to the contrary, if Tenant exercises an option to extend the Lease Term at any time when Landlord is concurrently in violation of this section, and, at the time of Tenant‚Äôs election of its option to extend Tenant has failed to enforce its rights under this section for Landlord‚Äôs breach of its obligations within 90 days from the date Tenant notifies Landlord of the violation, in either of such events, Tenant shall be deemed to have waived its rights and remedies available under this section. Further, Tenant shall have no remedy for a violation of this section if another tenant or occupant in the Building violates the Exclusive Use by manner or use of its premises and (i) Landlord provides notice of the lease violation to such other tenant or occupant in the Building; and (ii) either the other tenant or occupant ceases the violation within 90 days, or Landlord commences an action (or arbitration, if required by such lease) against such other tenant or occupant in the Building, and thereafter uses good-faith efforts to enforce its rights under such lease.

                                 3.4.5 No Solicitation. During the Lease Term, Tenant shall not directly solicit by phone, in person contact, mail, e-mail, direct message, or other form of communication directed to a specific recipient any of Landlord‚Äôs Customers (as defined below) for lease, use, or occupancy of space in the Premises in connection with Tenant‚Äôs business. ‚ÄúSolicit‚Äù shall mean touring, or offering to tour, the Premises; offering or proposing terms to lease a suite in the Premises; entering into a letter of intent or proposal to lease a suite in the Premises; or providing a copy of Tenant‚Äôs membership agreement. ‚ÄúLandlord‚Äôs Customers‚Äù shall mean any person or entity who shall at that time be a tenant, subtenant, or other occupant of any part of the Building. This section shall not prohibit Tenant from advertising generally to the public, such as by newspaper, magazine, website, TV, radio, social media, and other forms of non-direct general advertisement.

                                                  3. Introduction

              3.1. Study Rationale

              A prandial insulin with faster-on and/or faster-off characteristics might reduce glycemic excursions and the incidence of postprandial hypoglycemia compared to currently available fast-acting insulin analogs. LY900014 is an ultra-rapid-acting insulin lispro formulation that has shown an increased early absorption compared to commercially available insulin lispro (Humalog¬Æ; Eli Lilly). LY900014 aims to closely mimic the physiological prandial insulin secretion pattern, which may more effectively control postprandial glucose excursions and allow increased flexibility of the time of dosing relative to a meal.

              This study aims to compare PK and PD profiles as well as the improved action of insulin lispro from LY900014 on the control of postprandial blood glucose in comparison to Humalog in patients with T1DM. The improved action of insulin lispro will be assessed by using standardized mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTTs). Furthermore, this study will explore the postprandial glucose profiles with LY900014 and Humalog injected at two different meal-to- dose time intervals either immediately before or 20 minutes following the start of the test meal, to optimize future use of this investigational medicinal product (IMP).

              3.2. Background

              The insulin analog insulin lispro (Humalog) has been shown to be absorbed more quickly than regular human insulin (Humalog package insert, 2015). In healthy volunteers given subcutaneous (SC) doses of insulin lispro ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 units (U)/kg, peak serum levels were seen 30 to 90 minutes after dosing (Humalog package insert, 2015). However, the general consensus is that rapid-acting insulin is still not rapid enough to match carbohydrate absorption profiles, which limits efficacy and dosing flexibility. An ultra-rapid-acting prandial insulin would shift the PK/GD of insulin analogs so that they have an even faster onset to better match carbohydrate absorption and also allow greater flexibility in the time of dosing relative to meals.

              LY900014 represents a new formulation that contains insulin lispro, treprostinil, citrate and other excipients. This formulation involves the novel use of a microdose of treprostinil ( C ) as an excipient to enhance the absorption of insulin lispro by local vasodilatation rather than as C an active pharmaceutical ingredient to elicit a systemic effect. Treprostinil is a prostacyclin analogue, administered either through inhalation ( C ), as an intravenous (IV) infusion or as a continuous SC administration for the treatment of symptomatic C pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and has been approved in the US since 2002 and in Germany since 2006 (AMIS database [WWW]). Sodium citrate, an excipient that speeds insulin absorption (at least in part by enhancing vascular permeability), is also included in the formulation to further enhance the absorption of insulin lispro. Each of the other excipients (such as magnesium chloride) in the LY900014 formulation is listed in the US Food and Drug Administration

              (FDA)‚Äôs Generally Recognized as Safe Food Additives database and in the FDA‚Äôs Inactive Ingredients in Approved Drugs database. Furthermore, the excipient concentration in LY900014 is within the limits identified for approved drug products in the FDA Inactive Ingredients in Approved Drugs database. To date, LY900014 has been administered to approximately 89 patients with diabetes (60 T1DM and 29 T2DM) across 3 Phase 1b studies and approximately 107 healthy volunteers across these Phase 1 studies. The total insulin lispro exposure was similar between LY900014 and Humalog; however LY900014 demonstrated a faster and earlier insulin lispro absorption compared to Humalog. Additionally, through the use of multiple daily injections of LY900014 for up to 2 weeks in patients with either T1DM or T2DM, it was found that LY900014 was well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study treatment or discontinuations from the studies because of a drug-related adverse event (AE). Small numbers of treatment-emergent adverse events were reported, and there were no notable increases in these events in relation to any of the LY900014 formulations compared to those in relation to Humalog. There were no reported cases of severe hypoglycemia. Additionally, there was no reported incidences of local or systemic allergic reactions.

              3.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment

              This study will not offer any direct benefits to the patients participating in the study. The data from previous studies in healthy patients and patients with T1DM and T2DM have shown that LY900014 was well tolerated and the adverse drug reactions are in keeping with those reported for Humalog.

              Potential risks associated with LY900014, derived from the known risks of insulin lispro (Humalog), are hypoglycemia, hypersensitivity reactions (localized allergy and/or systemic allergy), undesirable effects at the injection site (injection-site reactions and lipodystrophy), and peripheral edema (Humalog package insert, 2015).

              Notably, across all doses in the studies that have evaluated treprostinil ( CCI ) as a local vasodilator with or without insulin lispro, there was no clinically significant increase in those AEs associated with systemic absorption of treprostinil, as described in the CCI package insert (2014). The exposures of treprostinil in LY900014 in this study are expected to be undetectable compared to those observed in the dose ranges previously explored with SC bolus administration of treprostinil and are expected to be substantially lower than those observed in the treatment of PAH. No known potential risks are associated with the use of small amounts of treprostinil in the LY900014 formulation.

              In preclinical safety pharmacology and toxicity studies, or clinical pharmacology studies involving LY900014 or treprostinil alone, other than known risks associated with Humalog and CCI , no additional risks were identified. Additionally, local and systemic toxicity profiles of Humalog and CCI do not suggest the potential for additive or synergistic toxicity

              The study includes inpatient procedures during which participants will be continuously monitored. Patients will be without food intake from the start of the MMTT to completion of blood collection (approximately 420 minutes) unless required to treat hypoglycemia, (see Section

              9.5.6.2 for definition of hypoglycemia and Section 9.5.8 for treatment guidelines). If a patient experiences elevated blood glucose following food intake for more than 1 hour, insulin glulisine will be administered intravenously (see Section 9.5.8 for treatment guidelines). Patients will maintain their basal insulin regimen of site-provided insulin glargine during the entire study including the MMTT days unless safety issues arise; in this case, the investigator will discuss a change of the basal insulin regimen with the sponsor clinical pharmacologist (CP) and implement this change, if necessary, to prevent any medical problems.

              More information about the known and expected benefits, risks, serious adverse events (SAEs) and reasonably anticipated adverse events (AEs) of LY900014 are to be found in the Investigator‚Äôs Brochure (IB).
