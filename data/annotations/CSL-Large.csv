"This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (this ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù) is entered into and made effective as of 4/30/2019 between Docugami Inc., a Delaware corporation, whose address is 150 Lake Street South, Suite 221, Kirkland, Washington 98033, and Billi Seager, an individual, whose address is 55 Brooksby Village Way, Danvers MA 1923.

The above named parties desire to engage in discussions regarding a potential agreement or other transaction between the parties (the ‚ÄúPurpose‚Äù). In connection with such discussions, it may be necessary for the parties to disclose to each other certain confidential information or materials to enable them to evaluate whether to enter into such agreement or transaction.

In consideration of the foregoing, the parties agree as follows:

1.   Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, ‚ÄúConfidential Information‚Äù means any information or materials disclosed by one party to the other party that: (i) if disclosed in writing or in the form of tangible materials, is marked ‚Äúconfidential‚Äù or ‚Äúproprietary‚Äù at the time of such disclosure; (ii) if disclosed orally or by visual presentation, is identified as ‚Äúconfidential‚Äù or ‚Äúproprietary‚Äù at the time of such disclosure, and is summarized in a writing sent by the disclosing party to the receiving party within thirty (30) days after any such disclosure; or (iii) due to its nature or the circumstances of its disclosure, a person exercising reasonable business judgment would understand to be confidential or proprietary.



2.   Obligations and Restrictions. Each party agrees: (i) to maintain the other party's Confidential Information in strict confidence; (ii) not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third party; and (iii) not to use such Confidential Information for any purpose except for the Purpose. Each party may disclose the other party‚Äôs Confidential Information to its employees and consultants who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for the Purpose, but solely to the extent necessary to pursue the Purpose and for no other purpose; provided, that each such employee and consultant first executes a written agreement (or is otherwise already bound by a written agreement) that contains use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective of the other party‚Äôs Confidential Information as those set forth in this Agreement.



3.   Exceptions. The obligations and restrictions in Section 2 will not apply to any information or materials that:



(i)   were, at the date of disclosure, or have subsequently become, generally known or available to the public through no act or failure to act by the receiving party;



(ii)  were rightfully known by the receiving party prior to receiving such information or materials from the disclosing party;



(iii)  are rightfully acquired by the receiving party from a third party who has the right to disclose such information or materials without breach of any confidentiality obligation to the disclosing party; or



(iv)  are independently developed by the receiving party without access to any Confidential Information of the disclosing party.





4.   Compelled Disclosure. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to restrict a party from disclosing the other party‚Äôs Confidential Information to the extent required by any order, subpoena, law, statute or regulation; provided, that the party required to make such a disclosure uses reasonable efforts to give the other party reasonable advance notice of such required disclosure in order to enable the other party to prevent or limit such disclosure.



5.   Return of Confidential Information. Upon the completion or abandonment of the Purpose, and in any event upon the disclosing party‚Äôs request, the receiving party will promptly return to the disclosing party all tangible items and embodiments containing or consisting of the disclosing party‚Äôs Confidential Information and all copies thereof (including electronic copies), and any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations, memoranda or other documents (regardless of the form thereof) prepared by or on behalf of the receiving party that contain or are based upon the disclosing party‚Äôs Confidential Information.



6.   No Obligations. Each party retains the right, in its sole discretion, to determine whether to disclose any Confidential Information to the other party. Neither party will be required to negotiate nor enter into any other agreements or arrangements with the other party, whether or not related to the Purpose.



7.   No License. All Confidential Information remains the sole and exclusive property of the disclosing party. Each party acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Agreement will be construed as granting any rights to the receiving party, by license or otherwise, in or to any Confidential Information of the disclosing party, or any patent, copyright or other intellectual property or proprietary rights of the disclosing party, except as specified in this Agreement.



8.   No Warranty. ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED BY THE DISCLOSING PARTY ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù.



9.   Term. This Agreement will remain in effect for a period of five (5) years from the date of last disclosure of Confidential Information by either party, at which time it will terminate.



10.  Equitable Relief. Each party acknowledges that the unauthorized use or disclosure of the disclosing party‚Äôs Confidential Information may cause the disclosing party to incur irreparable harm and significant damages, the degree of which may be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, each party agrees that the disclosing party will have the right to seek immediate equitable relief to enjoin any unauthorized use or disclosure of its Confidential Information, in addition to any other rights and remedies that it may have at law or otherwise.



11.  Miscellaneous. This Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, excluding its body of law controlling conflict of laws. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings and communications, oral or written, between the parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision of this Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Neither party may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without the other party‚Äôs prior written consent, and any attempted assignment without such consent will be void. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.",Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement,Confidential Information

                   ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS SPECIFIC TO YOUR NOTE

             Assuming No Changes in Market Conditions and Other Relevant Factors, the Value of Your Note on the Date of This Pricing Supplement (As Determined by Reference to Pricing Models Used by Goldman Sachs) May Be Significantly Less than the Original Issue Price

                The value or quoted price of your note at any time will reflect many factors and cannot be predicted. If Goldman Sachs makes a market in the notes, the price quoted by us or our affiliates for your note would reflect any changes in market conditions and other relevant factors, including a deterioration in our creditworthiness or perceived creditworthiness whether measured by our credit ratings or other credit measures. These changes may adversely affect the market price of your notes, including the price you may receive for your notes in any market making transaction. In addition, even if our creditworthiness does not decline, the value of your note on the trade date may be significantly less than the original price taking into account our credit spreads on that date. The quoted price could be higher or lower than the original issue price, and may be higher or lower than the value of your note as determined by reference to pricing models used by Goldman Sachs.

                If at any time a third party dealer quotes a price to purchase your note or otherwise values your note, that price may be significantly different (higher or lower) than any price quoted by Goldman Sachs. See ‚ÄúRisk Factors ‚Äî Considerations Relating to Notes Generally ‚Äî The Market Price of Any Notes We May Issue May Be Influenced by Many Unpredictable Factors and If You Buy a Note and Sell It Prior to the Stated Maturity Date, You May Receive Less Than the Face Amount of Your Note‚Äù in the Offering Circular.

                Furthermore, if you sell your note, you will likely be charged a commission for secondary market transactions, or the price will likely reflect a dealer discount. There is no assurance that Goldman Sachs or any other party will be willing to purchase your note, and in this regard Goldman Sachs is not obligated to make a market in your note. See ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚ÄîConsiderations Relating to Notes Generally‚ÄîAny Notes We May Issue May Not Have an Active Trading Market‚Äù in the Offering Circular.

             The Market Price of the Notes May Be

             Influenced by Many Unpredictable Factors and If You Sell Your Note Prior to the Stated Maturity Date, You May Receive Less Than the Accreted Value of Your Note

                 The following factors, most of which are beyond our control, will influence the market price of the notes:

             ÔÇ∑ economic, military, financial, regulatory, political, terrorist and other events that affect securities generally;

             ÔÇ∑ interest and yield rates in the market;

             ÔÇ∑ the time remaining until a note matures; and

             ÔÇ∑ our creditworthiness. As a result of these and other factors, if you sell your note prior to maturity, you may receive less than the accreted value of your note. Moreover, these factors interrelate in complex ways, and the effect of one factor may offset or enhance the effect of another factor.

             The Notes May Not Have an Active Trading Market

                 We have appointed KGI Securities Co. Ltd., and KGI Securities Co. Ltd. has agreed to act, as the liquidity provider for providing quotations in respect of the notes listed on the TPEx in accordance with Article 24-1 of the TPEx Rules and the relevant regulations.

                 Neither we, nor any of our affiliates, have any obligation to make a market in the notes. Even if a secondary market for the notes develops, it may not provide significant liquidity. The transaction costs in any such secondary market may be high. As a result, the difference between bid and asked prices for the note in any secondary market could be substantial.

             Listing of the Notes on TPEx

                 Application will be made for the listing of the notes on the TPEx. No assurance can be given as to whether the notes will be, or will remain,

             listed on the TPEx. If the notes fail to or cease to be listed on the TPEx, certain investors may not invest in, or continue to hold or invest in, the notes.

             We Have the Right to Redeem Your Note at Our Option

                On each early redemption date listed above, we will have the option to redeem your notes at a price equal to the product of (i) the face amount outstanding on such early redemption date, multiplied by (ii) the relevant early

                                                     S-7 redemption amount listed above which corresponds to such early redemption date, by notice to Euroclear Bank SA/NV and Clearstream Banking, soci√©t√© anonyme, no fewer than five (5) business days prior to the relevant early redemption date. Even if we do not exercise this option, our ability to do so may adversely affect the value of your notes.

Limited Warranty.



       (a)  The Software and Related Materials are owned by Licensor and are protected by

       U.S. copyright laws and applicable international treaties and/or conventions. Without limiting the prohibition on assignment contained elsewhere in this Agreement, Licensee acknowledges that its rights to use the Software and Related Materials are personal to Licensee.

       (c)  As to any Software and Related Materials which are or in the opinion of Licensor may become subject to a claim of infringement, Licensor, at its option, will obtain the right for Licensee to continue using the Software and Related Materials or replace or modify the Software and Related Materials so as to make it non- infringing. If none of the aforementioned alternatives are available on commercially reasonable terms, then Licensee agrees to return the Software and Related Materials to Licensor upon Licensor's written request and Licensor shall, upon return, refund to Licensee all license fees paid by Licensee to Licensor, and Licensor shall have no other or further liability to Licensee.

                         6.1 General; Definition of Transfer. Neither Tenant nor Tenant's legal representatives or successors in interest by operation of law or otherwise shall transfer this Lease except as provided in this article. For purposes of this article, a ""transfer"" shall mean any of the following: (a) an assignment of this Lease; (b) a collateral assignment, mortgage, or other encumbrance involving this Lease; (c) a sublease, license agreement, or other agreement permitting all or any portion of the Premises to be used by others; (d) a reduction of Tenant's assets to the point that this Lease is substantially Tenant's only asset; (e) a change or conversion in the form of entity of Tenant or any transferee or any entity controlling any of them which has the effect of limiting the liability of any of the partners, members, or other owners of the entity; (f) the agreement by a third party to assume, take over, or reimburse Tenant for any of Tenant's obligations under this Lease in order to induce Tenant to lease space from the third party; or (g) any transfer of direct or indirect control of Tenant, which shall be defined as any issuance or transfer of stock in any corporate tenant or subtenant or any interest in any non- corporation entity tenant or subtenant, by sale, exchange, merger, consolidation, operation of law, or otherwise, or creation of new stock or interests, by which an aggregate of 50% or more of Tenant's stock or equity interests shall be vested in one or more parties who are not stockholders or interest holders as of the Date of this Lease, or any transfer of the power to direct the operations of any entity (by equity ownership, contract, or otherwise), to one or more parties who are not stockholders or interest holders as of the Date of this Lease, however accomplished, and whether in a single transaction or in a series of related or unrelated transactions. This section shall not apply to sales of stock by persons other than those deemed ""insiders"" within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, which sales are effected through any recognized securities exchange. Any modification or amendment to any sublease of any portion of the Premises shall be deemed a further sublease of this Lease. As used in this article, the term ""transferee"" shall include any assignee or subtenant of Tenant or any other party involved in any of the other transactions or events constituting a transfer. Consent by Landlord to a transfer shall not relieve Tenant from the obligation to obtain Landlord's written consent to any further transfer. Any transfer by Tenant in violation of this article shall be void and shall constitute a default under this Lease.

                         6.2 Request for Consent. If Tenant requests Landlord's consent to a transfer, it shall submit in writing to Landlord, not later than 30 days before any anticipated transfer, (a) the name and address of the proposed transferee, (b) a duly executed counterpart of the proposed transfer agreement, (c) reasonably satisfactory information as to the nature and character of the business of the proposed transferee, as to the nature and character of its proposed use of the space, and otherwise responsive to the criteria set forth in the Reasonable Consent section of this article, and (d) banking, financial, or other credit information relating to the proposed transferee reasonably sufficient to enable Landlord to determine the financial responsibility and character of the proposed transferee, including balance sheets and profit and loss statements for the transferee covering the three years before the transfer, certified by the transferee, and a list of personal, banking, business, and credit references for the transferee.

                         6.3 Recapture. Landlord shall have the following options to be exercised within 15 Business Days from submission of Tenant's request for Landlord's consent to a specific transfer: (i) If Tenant proposes to assign this Lease or sublet all or substantially all of the Premises, Landlord shall have the option to cancel and terminate this Lease as of the proposed commencement date for the transfer, and (ii) If Tenant proposes to sublet less than all or substantially all of the Premises or if a proposed sublease shall be for less than the balance of the Lease Term, Landlord shall have the option of canceling and terminating this Lease only as to the applicable portion of the Premises and the applicable portion of the Lease Term covered by the proposed sublease, effective as of the proposed commencement date of the sublease. If Landlord exercises this option, all Rent for the Premises shall be equitably apportioned as of the commencement date of the sublease and Landlord, at Tenant's expense, shall perform all work and make all alterations as may be required to physically separate the applicable portion of the Premises from the remainder of the Premises and to permit lawful occupancy of the separated portion.

                         6.4 Reasonable Consent. If Landlord does not elect either of the options provided in the Recapture section of this article, Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to a proposed transfer. It shall be deemed reasonable for Landlord to withhold consent to any proposed transfer if any of the following conditions have not been established to Landlord's satisfaction:

                                 6.4.1 The proposed transferee has sufficient financial wherewithal to discharge its obligations under this Lease as determined by Landlord's criteria for selecting Project tenants and has a tangible net worth, experience, and reputation that is not less than the tangible net worth, experience, and reputation of Tenant on the Date of this Lease or the date of the transfer, whichever is greater. ""Tangible net worth"" shall mean the excess of the value of tangible assets (i.e. assets excluding those which are intangible such as goodwill, patents and trademarks) over liabilities.

                                 6.4.2 The use, nature, business, activities, or reputation in the business community of the proposed transferee will not cause physical harm to the Project or harm to the reputation of the Project that would result in an impairment of Landlord's ability to lease space in the Project or a diminution in the rental value of space in the Project.

                                 6.4.3 The proposed use of the Premises by the proposed transferee will be the Permitted Use and not prohibited by the Rules and Regulations, and will not violate any restrictive covenants or exclusive use provisions applicable to Landlord, cause a violation of another lease for space in the Project, or give an occupant of the Project a right to cancel its lease.

                                 6.4.4 The proposed transferee shall not be any person or entity who shall at that time be a tenant, subtenant, or other occupant of any part of the Project, or an affiliate of any of them, or who dealt with Landlord or Landlord's agent (directly or through a broker) as to space in the Project during the six months immediately preceding Tenant's request for Landlord's consent.

                                 6.4.5 The proposed use of the Premises by the proposed transferee will not require alterations or additions to the Premises or the Project to comply with applicable law or governmental requirements and will not negatively affect insurance requirements or involve the introduction of materials to the Premises that are not in compliance with applicable environmental laws.

                                 6.4.6 Any mortgagee of the Project will consent to the proposed transfer if such consent is required under the relevant loan documents.

                                 6.4.7 The proposed use of the Premises will not materially increase the operating costs for the Project or the burden on Project services, or generate excessive foot traffic, elevator usage, Parking Area usage, or security concerns in the Project, or compromise or reduce the comfort or safety, or both, of Landlord and the other occupants of the Project.

                                 6.4.8 The proposed transferee shall not be, and shall not be affiliated with, anyone with whom Landlord or any of its affiliates or mortgagees has been involved with in litigation or who has defaulted under any agreement with Landlord or any of its affiliates.

                                 6.4.9 There shall be no default by Tenant, beyond any applicable grace period, under any of the terms, covenants, and conditions of this Lease at the time that Landlord's consent to a transfer is requested and on the date of the commencement of the term of the proposed transfer.

                                 6.4.10 If the resulting tenant entity does not have equal or greater tangible net worth and creditworthiness as Tenant as of the Date of this Lease or the date of transfer, whichever is greater, Landlord, at its option, may approve the transfer subject to an increase in the Security Deposit, or receipt of new personal guarantees acceptable to Landlord, or both.

                 Section 2.1 Carrier shall be compensated for each Shipment in accordance with the rates set forth on IBIDTransport.com, a web-based rate management system, or based on the delivery destination of the cargo, the total number of tons of cargo hauled by Carrier and the agreed upon rate as contained in the applicable purchase order. The fees paid to Carrier shall be no more favorable than the fees paid by Shipper to any other third party carrier. User name and password will be issued by Ilens Logistics Group at the request of Sandy‚Äôs Express. Carrier agrees that ‚ÄúP. C. Miler v.14‚Äù shortest miles option shall be utilized as the basis for computing the mileage from the point of origination of a shipment to the point of destination of a Shipment. Any deviation from this aforementioned method must be approved in advance in writing by Shipper.

                   Section 2.2 Carrier represents and warrants that, during the term of this Agreement, the rates agreed upon hereunder as may be modified in accordance with the terms hereof from time to time, together with all charges, surcharges, rebates, discounts, incentives and allowances agreed upon by the parties (collectively, ‚ÄúPricing Terms‚Äù), offered to Sandy‚Äôs Express under this Agreement, are and will remain as favorable as, or better than the Pricing Terms offered by Carrier to any other shipper shipping similar products in like quantities. In the event that Carrier at any time agrees, in writing or otherwise, to Pricing Terms with another shipper that are in any way more favorable than the Pricing Terms agreed to with Sandy‚Äôs Express, Carrier shall promptly notify Sandy‚Äôs Express in writing and offer such terms to Sandy‚Äôs Express. In the event Sandy‚Äôs Express accepts such modified terms, the parties shall promptly prepare and execute an amendment to this Agreement reflecting such revised terms. Carrier (or its applicable subsidiary) shall annually on the anniversary of this Agreement, certify to Sandy‚Äôs Express that Carrier

                                                    remains in compliance with this provision.

                 Section 2.3 At the time the Shipment is fully delivered, an invoice covering that Shipment will be generated by Carrier and delivered to Shipper, in accordance with the rates Carrier places in IBID, or based on the delivery destination of the cargo, the total number of tons of cargo hauled by Carrier and the agreed upon rate as contained in the applicable purchase order. The invoice will be due and payable thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the invoice, provided that on or before said date Shipper has received from Carrier (i) duly executed receipt(s) from whom delivery was made concerning the applicable invoice, and (ii) such other supporting materials as Shipper may reasonably require.

                 Section 2.4 Carrier shall maintain complete and accurate records of each Shipment and all transactions under

                    this Agreement, including all supporting documentation and proof of delivery, and in a manner consistent with generally acceptable accounting procedures. Within two (2) days notice by Shipper, Carrier shall provide Shipper and/or its representatives with access to and the right to examine all records involving any transaction related to the Agreement. Such right shall be for the period covered by this Agreement and until the expiration of five (5) years

                                                       after termination of this Agreement.

In exchange for Shipper‚Äôs guarantee of prompt payment, (i) agrees not to contact Shipper‚Äôs customers, consignors, consignees or any party other than Shipper

                      concerning payment for transportation services; and, (ii) agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Shipper, its customers, consignors, and consignees harmless from any claim or demand made by any subcontractor of Carrier or other party for payment for transportation services related to a shipment of cargo tendered under this Agreement.

                             Section 3.2 Any claim for overpayment or underpayment for transportation services provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be presented by the party asserting the claim to the other party within sixty (60) days of discovery of the claim, but in no event will any such claim(s) be asserted more than one hundred eighty

"8. DEFAULT.

                         8.1 Events of Default. Each of the following shall be an event of default under this Lease: (a) Tenant fails to make any payment of Rent when due; (b) Tenant or any Guarantor for Tenant's obligations under this Lease becomes bankrupt or insolvent or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or takes the benefit of any insolvency act, or if any debtor proceedings are taken by or against Tenant or any Guarantor, or any Guarantor dies; (c) Tenant abandons the Premises; (d) Tenant transfers this Lease in violation of the Assignment or Subletting article; (e) Tenant fails to deliver an estoppel certificate or subordination agreement or maintain required insurance coverages within the time periods required by this Lease; (f) Tenant does not comply with its obligations to vacate the Premises under the End of Term article of this Lease; or (g) Tenant fails to perform any other obligation under this Lease.

                         8.2 Remedies. If Tenant defaults, in addition to all remedies provided by law, including the right to terminate this Lease, Landlord may declare the entire balance of all Rent due under this Lease for the remainder of the Lease Term to be forthwith due and payable and may collect the then present value of the Rents (calculated using a discount rate equal to the discount rate of the branch of the Federal Reserve Bank closest to the Premises in effect as of the date of the default). Tenant waives all rights of redemption or to prevent a forfeiture that it has under applicable law after this Lease has been terminated or Tenant has surrendered or abandoned the Premises or has been evicted or otherwise dispossessed from the Premises.

                         8.3 Landlord's Right to Perform. If Tenant defaults, Landlord may, but shall have no obligation to, perform the obligations of Tenant, and if Landlord, in doing so, makes any expenditures or incurs any obligation for the payment of money, including reasonable attorneys' fees, the sums so paid or obligations incurred shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord upon receipt of a bill or statement to Tenant therefor.

                         8.4 Late Charges, Interest, and Bad Checks. If any payment due Landlord shall not be paid within five days of the date when due, Tenant shall pay, in addition to the payment then due, an administrative charge equal to the greater of (a) 5% of the past due payment; or (b) $500. All payments due Landlord shall bear interest at the lesser of: (a) 18% per annum, or (b) the highest rate of interest permitted to be charged by applicable law, accruing from the date the obligation arose through the date payment is actually received by Landlord, including after the date of any judgment against Tenant. If any check given to Landlord for any payment is dishonored for any reason whatsoever not attributable to Landlord, in addition to all other remedies available to Landlord, upon demand, Tenant will reimburse Landlord for all insufficient funds, bank, or returned check fees, plus an administrative fee not to exceed the maximum amount prescribed by law. In addition, Landlord may require all future payments from Tenant to be made by ACH payments, or by Federal Reserve wire transfer to Landlord's account.

                         8.5 Limitations. None of the Landlord Parties shall ever have any personal liability to Tenant. No person holding Landlord's interest shall have any liability after such person ceases to hold such interest, except for any liability accruing while such person held such interest. TENANT SHALL LOOK SOLELY TO LANDLORD'S ESTATE AND INTEREST IN THE BUILDING FOR THE SATISFACTION OF ANY CLAIMS BY TENANT OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER ARISING FROM THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES OR ANY RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS THEY MAY HAVE RELATING TO THE PROJECT, THIS LEASE, OR ANYTHING RELATED TO EITHER, AND NO OTHER ASSETS OF LANDLORD SHALL BE SUBJECT TO LEVY, EXECUTION, OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE FOR THE SATISFACTION OF TENANT'S RIGHTS OR REMEDIES, OR ANY OTHER LIABILITY OF LANDLORD TO TENANT OF WHATEVER KIND OR NATURE. No act or omission of Landlord or its agents shall constitute an actual or constructive eviction of Tenant or a default by Landlord as to any of its obligations under this Lease unless Landlord shall have first received written notice from Tenant of the claimed default and shall have failed to cure it after having been afforded reasonable time in which to do so, which in no event shall be less than 30 days. Further, Tenant waives any claims against Landlord that Tenant does not make in writing within 30 days of the onset of the cause of such claim.

                         8.6 Presumption of Abandonment. It shall be conclusively presumed that Tenant has abandoned the Premises if Tenant fails to keep the Premises open for business during regular business hours for ten consecutive days while in monetary default. Any grace periods set forth in this article shall not apply to the application of this presumption.

                         8.7 Multiple Defaults. Tenant acknowledges that any rights or options to extend the Lease Term, expand or contract the size of the Premises, terminate this Lease, have Building or monument signage, or other similar special rights or options, that have been granted to Tenant under this Lease are conditioned on the prompt and diligent performance of the terms of this Lease by Tenant. Accordingly, should Tenant, on three or more occasions during any 12-month period or on four or more occasions during any 36-month period or on six or more occasions during the Lease Term (each of these cases being a ‚ÄúMultiple Defaults Trigger‚Äù), (a) fail to pay any installment of rent when due; or (b) otherwise default under this Lease in a non-monetary manner; in addition to all other remedies available to Landlord, then all such rights and options shall automatically, and without further action on the part of any party, expire and be deemed canceled and of no further force and effect. The total number of events under both (a) and (b) above cumulatively will be added together to determine whether Tenant has reached one of the three thresholds resulting in a loss of rights as provided in this section.",Default and Remedies,Default and Remedies

"12. COMMON AREAS. The ""Common Areas"" of the Project include such areas and facilities as delivery facilities, walkways, landscaped and planted areas, a conference center, a fitness center, and parking facilities and are those areas designated by Landlord for the general use in common of occupants of the Project, including Tenant. The Common Areas shall at all times be subject to the exclusive control and management of Landlord. Landlord may charge Tenant a Building Standard fee for Tenant's exclusive temporary use of any Common Areas such as delivery facilities. Landlord may grant third parties specific rights concerning portions of the Common Areas. Landlord may, without it constituting an actual or constructive eviction, and without otherwise incurring any liability to Tenant, increase, reduce, improve, or otherwise alter the Common Areas, otherwise make improvements, alterations, additions, or reductions to the Project, and change the name or number by which the Building or Project is known. Landlord may also temporarily close the Common Areas to make repairs or improvements. Landlord has the right, but not the obligation, in its sole and absolute discretion, to temporarily close the Building or access to portions thereof, including any Common Area and the Premises, if there is any act or threat of any act of terrorism, war, violence, vandalism, civil unrest, riot, pandemic or health emergency, or other event that may pose a threat to the public health or safety or damage to the Building, including a hurricane warning, any advisory warning, directive, or notice from the Office of Homeland Security, the Center for Disease Control, or any other federal, state, or local governmental or enforcement agency (any of the foregoing, ‚ÄúCivil Unrest‚Äù). Tenant shall comply with any notice from Landlord or any governmental agency to close the Building or portions thereof and to immediately cause all of its employees, agents, contactors, and invitees to vacate the Building. Landlord will not be responsible for any loss or damage to Tenant‚Äôs business as a result, and Tenant will not be entitled to any abatement in rent or other relief of its obligations under this Lease for any period of time when Tenant may not have access to the Premises or Building due to any Civil Unrest or Landlord‚Äôs exercise of any of its other rights under this section. This Lease does not create, nor will Tenant have any express or implied easement for, or other rights to, air, light, or view over, from, or about the Project.

                13. SECURITY INTEREST. As security for Tenant's obligations under this Lease, Tenant grants to Landlord a security interest in this Lease and all property of Tenant now or hereafter placed in or upon the Premises including, all fixtures, furniture, inventory, machinery, equipment, merchandise, furnishings, and other articles of personal property, and all insurance proceeds of or relating to Tenant's property and all accessions and additions to, substitutions for, and replacements, products, and proceeds of the Tenant's property. This Lease constitutes a security agreement under the Florida Uniform Commercial Code. This security interest shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease and Landlord may, at any time, file a financing statement with the appropriate state or governmental agency with respect to such interest.

                14. CASUALTY DAMAGE. If the Project or any portion of it is damaged or destroyed by any casualty and: (a) the Building or Project or a material part of the Common Areas shall be so damaged that substantial alteration or reconstruction shall, in Landlord's opinion, be required (whether or not the Premises shall have been damaged by the casualty); or (b) Landlord is not permitted to rebuild the Building or Project or a material part of the Common Areas in substantially the same form as it existed before the damage; or (c) the Premises shall be materially damaged by casualty during the last two years of the Lease Term; or (d) any mortgagee requires that the insurance proceeds be applied to the payment of the mortgage debt; or (e) the damage is not fully covered by insurance maintained by Landlord; then Landlord may, within 90 days after the casualty, give notice to Tenant of Landlord's election to terminate this Lease, and the balance of the Lease Term shall automatically expire on the fifth day after the notice is delivered. If Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease, provided that Tenant was operating from the Premises immediately prior to the casualty and will recommence operations after restoration of the Premises, Landlord shall proceed with reasonable diligence to restore the Building and the Premises to substantially the same condition they were in immediately before the casualty. However, Landlord shall not be required to restore any unleased premises in the Building or any portion of Tenant's property. Rent shall abate in proportion to the portion of the Premises not usable by Tenant as a result of any casualty resulting in damage to the Building which is covered by insurance carried or required to be carried by Landlord under this Lease, as of the date on which the Premises becomes unusable and the abatement shall continue until the date the Premises become tenantable again. Landlord shall not otherwise be liable to Tenant for any delay in restoring the Premises or any inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant or injury to Tenant's business resulting in any way from the damage or the repairs, Tenant's sole remedy being the right to an abatement of Rent.

                15. CONDEMNATION. If the whole or any substantial part of the Premises shall be condemned by eminent domain or acquired by private purchase in lieu of condemnation, this Lease shall terminate on the date on which possession of the Premises is delivered to the condemning authority and Rent shall be apportioned and paid to that date. If no portion of the Premises is taken but a substantial portion of the Project is taken, at Landlord's option, this Lease shall terminate on the date on which possession of such portion of the Project is delivered to the condemning authority and Rent shall be apportioned and paid to that date. Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord, and assigns to Landlord any claims it may have otherwise had, for the value of any unexpired portion of the Lease Term, or any Alterations. Tenant shall not be entitled to any part of the condemnation award or private purchase price. If this Lease is not terminated as provided above, Rent shall abate in proportion to the portion of the Premises condemned.

                16. REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE.

                         16.1 General. Landlord shall repair and maintain in good order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, the Common Areas, mechanical and equipment rooms, the roof of the Building, the exterior walls of the Building, the exterior windows of the Building, the structural portions of the Building, the elevators, and the electrical, plumbing, mechanical, fire protection, life safety, and air conditioning, heating, and ventilation (""HVAC"") systems servicing the Building. However, unless the Waiver of Subrogation section applies, Tenant shall pay the cost of any such repairs or maintenance resulting from acts or omissions of the Tenant Parties. Tenant waives the provisions of any law, or any right Tenant may have under common law, permitting Tenant to make repairs at Landlord's expense or to withhold Rent or terminate this Lease based on any alleged failure of Landlord to make repairs. Except to the extent Landlord is obligated to repair and maintain the Premises as provided above, Tenant shall, at its sole cost, repair, replace, and maintain the Premises (including the walls, ceilings, and floors in the Premises, and any specialized or supplemental electrical, lighting, plumbing, mechanical, fire protection, life safety and HVAC systems exclusively for Tenant's use) in a clean, attractive, first-class condition. All replacements shall be of equal quality and class to the original items replaced. Tenant shall not commit or allow to be committed any waste on any portion of the Premises.

                         16.2 Cosmetic Refurbishment. After the fifth anniversary of the Commencement Date, and thereafter upon the fifth anniversary of the completion of any Alterations under this section, Tenant shall refurbish the Premises, which as a result of wear, normal depreciation, or any other cause are of a quality which in Landlord's reasonable judgment is not consistent with the level of quality of, or generally prevailing within, the Project. Any such worn or depreciated improvements will be replaced with materials and workmanship of a quality at least equal to the original installation for which replacement is made and subject to the Alterations article. Landlord shall contribute up to 85% of such costs, not to exceed $600,000($1,230.55/sf), which payment shall be made within 30 days after substantial completion of the Alterations, and delivery to Landlord of final releases of lien from Tenant‚Äôs general contractor and all lienors giving notice as defined in the Florida Construction Lien Law and a final contractor‚Äôs affidavit from the general contractor in accordance with the Florida Construction Lien Law, and all other receipts and supporting information concerning payment for the work that Landlord may reasonably request.",Repair and Maintenance,Common Areas

"The insulin analog insulin lispro (Humalog) has been shown to be absorbed more quickly than regular human insulin (Humalog package insert, 2015). In healthy volunteers given subcutaneous (SC) doses of insulin lispro ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 units (U)/kg, peak serum levels were seen 30 to 90 minutes after dosing (Humalog package insert, 2015). However, the general consensus is that rapid-acting insulin is still not rapid enough to match carbohydrate absorption profiles, which limits efficacy and dosing flexibility. An ultra-rapid-acting prandial insulin would shift the PK/GD of insulin analogs so that they have an even faster onset to better match carbohydrate absorption and also allow greater flexibility in the time of dosing relative to meals.

              LY900014 represents a new formulation that contains insulin lispro, treprostinil, citrate and other excipients. This formulation involves the novel use of a microdose of treprostinil ( C ) as an excipient to enhance the absorption of insulin lispro by local vasodilatation rather than as C an active pharmaceutical ingredient to elicit a systemic effect. Treprostinil is a prostacyclin analogue, administered either through inhalation ( C ), as an intravenous (IV) infusion or as a continuous SC administration for the treatment of symptomatic C pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and has been approved in the US since 2002 and in Germany since 2006 (AMIS database [WWW]). Sodium citrate, an excipient that speeds insulin absorption (at least in part by enhancing vascular permeability), is also included in the formulation to further enhance the absorption of insulin lispro. Each of the other excipients (such as magnesium chloride) in the LY900014 formulation is listed in the US Food and Drug Administration

              (FDA)‚Äôs Generally Recognized as Safe Food Additives database and in the FDA‚Äôs Inactive Ingredients in Approved Drugs database. Furthermore, the excipient concentration in LY900014 is within the limits identified for approved drug products in the FDA Inactive Ingredients in Approved Drugs database. To date, LY900014 has been administered to approximately 89 patients with diabetes (60 T1DM and 29 T2DM) across 3 Phase 1b studies and approximately 107 healthy volunteers across these Phase 1 studies. The total insulin lispro exposure was similar between LY900014 and Humalog; however LY900014 demonstrated a faster and earlier insulin lispro absorption compared to Humalog. Additionally, through the use of multiple daily injections of LY900014 for up to 2 weeks in patients with either T1DM or T2DM, it was found that LY900014 was well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study treatment or discontinuations from the studies because of a drug-related adverse event (AE). Small numbers of treatment-emergent adverse events were reported, and there were no notable increases in these events in relation to any of the LY900014 formulations compared to those in relation to Humalog. There were no reported cases of severe hypoglycemia. Additionally, there was no reported incidences of local or systemic allergic reactions.",Formulation Details,Study Objectives

                                 6.4.5 The proposed use of the Premises by the proposed transferee will not require alterations or additions to the Premises or the Project to comply with applicable law or governmental requirements and will not negatively affect insurance requirements or involve the introduction of materials to the Premises that are not in compliance with applicable environmental laws.

                                 6.4.6 Any mortgagee of the Project will consent to the proposed transfer if such consent is required under the relevant loan documents.

                                 6.4.7 The proposed use of the Premises will not materially increase the operating costs for the Project or the burden on Project services, or generate excessive foot traffic, elevator usage, Parking Area usage, or security concerns in the Project, or compromise or reduce the comfort or safety, or both, of Landlord and the other occupants of the Project.

              Eligible patients who have satisfied the entry criteria and completed all screening procedures will return to the CRU at least 2 weeks prior to Period 1 Day -2 to begin a lead-in and insulin transition period. When patients visit the CRU to begin the lead-in period, patients will receive instruction on general diabetes education including measurement of self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) and receive instruction on the insulin transition (see Section 9.2.1). During the insulin transition period, patients will transition from their current basal insulin therapy to site- provided insulin glargine and Humalog CCI (see Section 9.2.1). Following insulin transition, patients will return to the CRU for the dose-finding assessment (see Section 9.2.2) on either the evening of Day -2, Period 1 or early morning of Day -1, Period 1. The dose-finding assessment will use Humalog administered immediately before a standardized liquid test meal (MMTT) to inform the dose of LY900014 and Humalog to be used during subsequent study MMTT assessments. Upon completion of the dose-finding assessment, patients will be randomised to 1 of 4 treatment sequences. Prior to the MMTT in each study period, patients will undergo a run-in period (see Section 9.2.3.1) to achieve a predetermined glucose target of 135 ¬±15 mg/dL (7.5 ¬±0.8 mmol/L). Once the glucose target has been attained, patients will proceed with the MMTT in which a single individualized SC dose of LY900014 or Humalog will be administered either immediately before the test meal or 20 minutes following the start of the test meal (see Section 9.2.3.2).

              Doses of LY900014 and Humalog during the 4 study periods will be separated by a minimum washout of approximately 21 hours. The maximum duration allowed for all 4 periods is approximately 6 weeks. Patients will continue using site-provided Humalog and insulin glargine during the washout periods between MMTTs (see Section 7.7 for use of concomitant medication and basal insulin). During the washout periods, patients will be instructed to perform regular blood glucose monitoring (see Section 9.5.7).

              Following completion of all study procedures in each Period, patients may be offered a meal and discharged from the CRU at the discretion of the principal investigator.

              Study governance considerations are described in detail in Appendix 3.

              5.2. Number of Participants

              Up to 36 patients may be enrolled so that approximately 30 patients complete the study. For purposes of this study, a patient completes the study when all scheduled procedures shown in the Schedule of Activities have been finished. Patients who drop out may be replaced, and the replacement patient will adopt all 4 assigned crossover treatments of the original patient‚Äôs randomization schedule.

              5.3. End of Study Definition

              End of the study is the date of the last visit or last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities (Section 2) for the last patient.

              5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design

              The study is a 4-period crossover design to reduce the variability of insulin PK and GD, as each patient will act as his/her own control. The total number of patients needed with a crossover design is less than the number needed with a parallel group design. A maximum duration of approximately 6 weeks is allowed for patients to complete all 4 assigned periods to minimize the risk of insulin resistance/changes in mean glycemic control during the study.

              Randomization and blinding are used to avoid bias introduced through an association between allocation order of investigational medicinal product (IMP) and patient characteristics. The Lilly clinical pharmacologist (CP)/Lilly study team will be unblinded.

              In each study period patients will undergo a run-in period before the MMTT using a variable insulin and glucose IV infusion. This run-in period will allow for improved comparability of the postprandial glucose response to a mixed meal after treatment with LY900014 and Humalog administered either immediately before the start of the meal, or 20 minutes following the start of the test meal. This run-in aims to achieve similar preprandial glucose levels for all patients before the start of the test meal and thereby reduces the variability of the postprandial glucose response. Insulin glulisine has been chosen for the IV optimization of blood glucose during the run-in because insulin glulisine does not cross-react with the insulin lispro‚Äìspecific assay used for the PK analysis.

              Under this design, if two periods occur on consecutive days, the interval between the last bolus on the first day and the first bolus on the second day is much longer compared to the length of time that the treatment (LY900014 or Humalog) lasts in the bloodstream; therefore, no carryover effect is assumed. This enables PK and GD data from the breakfast meal tests of each period to be analyzed independently and separately.

              A minimum of approximately 21 hours washout between the test meals allows for a complete washout of study drug administered with the MMTT and glucose response and prevents carry- over effects.

              5.5. Justification for Dose

              The bolus dose of insulin lispro (LY900014 or Humalog) will be individualized per patient to cover the carbohydrate content in this standardized liquid test meal. This dose of insulin is reflective of a clinically relevant, individualized insulin dosing, similar to how patients would determine the insulin dose for the carbohydrate content in a meal. For each patient, the individualized prandial insulin lispro dose in LY900014 and Humalog for each test meal must be kept identical throughout the crossover periods.

                                              6. Study Population

              Eligibility of patients for study enrollment will be based on the results of screening medical history, physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiogram (ECG).

              The nature of any conditions present at the time of the physical examination and any preexisting conditions will be documented.

              Screening may occur over a 14 day period prior to the lead-in site visit. Patients who are not entered within this time period, may be subjected to an additional medical assessment and/or clinical measurements to confirm their eligibility.

              Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, are not permitted.

              6.1. Inclusion Criteria

              Patients are eligible for inclusion in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria at screening and/or enrollment:

"3. Introduction

              3.1. Study Rationale

              A prandial insulin with faster-on and/or faster-off characteristics might reduce glycemic excursions and the incidence of postprandial hypoglycemia compared to currently available fast-acting insulin analogs. LY900014 is an ultra-rapid-acting insulin lispro formulation that has shown an increased early absorption compared to commercially available insulin lispro (Humalog¬Æ; Eli Lilly). LY900014 aims to closely mimic the physiological prandial insulin secretion pattern, which may more effectively control postprandial glucose excursions and allow increased flexibility of the time of dosing relative to a meal.

              This study aims to compare PK and PD profiles as well as the improved action of insulin lispro from LY900014 on the control of postprandial blood glucose in comparison to Humalog in patients with T1DM. The improved action of insulin lispro will be assessed by using standardized mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTTs). Furthermore, this study will explore the postprandial glucose profiles with LY900014 and Humalog injected at two different meal-to- dose time intervals either immediately before or 20 minutes following the start of the test meal, to optimize future use of this investigational medicinal product (IMP).

              3.2. Background

              The insulin analog insulin lispro (Humalog) has been shown to be absorbed more quickly than regular human insulin (Humalog package insert, 2015). In healthy volunteers given subcutaneous (SC) doses of insulin lispro ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 units (U)/kg, peak serum levels were seen 30 to 90 minutes after dosing (Humalog package insert, 2015). However, the general consensus is that rapid-acting insulin is still not rapid enough to match carbohydrate absorption profiles, which limits efficacy and dosing flexibility. An ultra-rapid-acting prandial insulin would shift the PK/GD of insulin analogs so that they have an even faster onset to better match carbohydrate absorption and also allow greater flexibility in the time of dosing relative to meals.

              LY900014 represents a new formulation that contains insulin lispro, treprostinil, citrate and other excipients. This formulation involves the novel use of a microdose of treprostinil ( C ) as an excipient to enhance the absorption of insulin lispro by local vasodilatation rather than as C an active pharmaceutical ingredient to elicit a systemic effect. Treprostinil is a prostacyclin analogue, administered either through inhalation ( C ), as an intravenous (IV) infusion or as a continuous SC administration for the treatment of symptomatic C pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and has been approved in the US since 2002 and in Germany since 2006 (AMIS database [WWW]). Sodium citrate, an excipient that speeds insulin absorption (at least in part by enhancing vascular permeability), is also included in the formulation to further enhance the absorption of insulin lispro. Each of the other excipients (such as magnesium chloride) in the LY900014 formulation is listed in the US Food and Drug Administration

              (FDA)‚Äôs Generally Recognized as Safe Food Additives database and in the FDA‚Äôs Inactive Ingredients in Approved Drugs database. Furthermore, the excipient concentration in LY900014 is within the limits identified for approved drug products in the FDA Inactive Ingredients in Approved Drugs database. To date, LY900014 has been administered to approximately 89 patients with diabetes (60 T1DM and 29 T2DM) across 3 Phase 1b studies and approximately 107 healthy volunteers across these Phase 1 studies. The total insulin lispro exposure was similar between LY900014 and Humalog; however LY900014 demonstrated a faster and earlier insulin lispro absorption compared to Humalog. Additionally, through the use of multiple daily injections of LY900014 for up to 2 weeks in patients with either T1DM or T2DM, it was found that LY900014 was well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study treatment or discontinuations from the studies because of a drug-related adverse event (AE). Small numbers of treatment-emergent adverse events were reported, and there were no notable increases in these events in relation to any of the LY900014 formulations compared to those in relation to Humalog. There were no reported cases of severe hypoglycemia. Additionally, there was no reported incidences of local or systemic allergic reactions.

              3.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment

              This study will not offer any direct benefits to the patients participating in the study. The data from previous studies in healthy patients and patients with T1DM and T2DM have shown that LY900014 was well tolerated and the adverse drug reactions are in keeping with those reported for Humalog.

              Potential risks associated with LY900014, derived from the known risks of insulin lispro (Humalog), are hypoglycemia, hypersensitivity reactions (localized allergy and/or systemic allergy), undesirable effects at the injection site (injection-site reactions and lipodystrophy), and peripheral edema (Humalog package insert, 2015).

              Notably, across all doses in the studies that have evaluated treprostinil ( CCI ) as a local vasodilator with or without insulin lispro, there was no clinically significant increase in those AEs associated with systemic absorption of treprostinil, as described in the CCI package insert (2014). The exposures of treprostinil in LY900014 in this study are expected to be undetectable compared to those observed in the dose ranges previously explored with SC bolus administration of treprostinil and are expected to be substantially lower than those observed in the treatment of PAH. No known potential risks are associated with the use of small amounts of treprostinil in the LY900014 formulation.

              In preclinical safety pharmacology and toxicity studies, or clinical pharmacology studies involving LY900014 or treprostinil alone, other than known risks associated with Humalog and CCI , no additional risks were identified. Additionally, local and systemic toxicity profiles of Humalog and CCI do not suggest the potential for additive or synergistic toxicity

              The study includes inpatient procedures during which participants will be continuously monitored. Patients will be without food intake from the start of the MMTT to completion of blood collection (approximately 420 minutes) unless required to treat hypoglycemia, (see Section

              9.5.6.2 for definition of hypoglycemia and Section 9.5.8 for treatment guidelines). If a patient experiences elevated blood glucose following food intake for more than 1 hour, insulin glulisine will be administered intravenously (see Section 9.5.8 for treatment guidelines). Patients will maintain their basal insulin regimen of site-provided insulin glargine during the entire study including the MMTT days unless safety issues arise; in this case, the investigator will discuss a change of the basal insulin regimen with the sponsor clinical pharmacologist (CP) and implement this change, if necessary, to prevent any medical problems.

              More information about the known and expected benefits, risks, serious adverse events (SAEs) and reasonably anticipated adverse events (AEs) of LY900014 are to be found in the Investigator‚Äôs Brochure (IB).
